As such the vendor, as owner of the property, could complete the sale and convey to the purchaser the title to the property even though a declaration of compulsory acquisition under s&nbsp;5 of the Act had been made and published; the effect of the declaration might be to diminish the value of the property but did not impeach the vendor’s title. He further held that the declaration did not destroy the subject matter of the agreement.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">In April 1983, the respondent vendor and the appellant purchaser entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“the agreement”) for a piece of property for the price of $2,138,200. Completion was to have taken place on 7&nbsp;July 1983, but this did not happen due to the purchaser’s delay. On 13&nbsp;July 1983 the vendor’s solicitors sent the purchaser’s solicitors a 21-day notice to complete. On the same day a declaration was made under s&nbsp;5 of the Act stating that the property was required for a public purpose. This declaration was gazetted on 19&nbsp;July 1983. On 1&nbsp;August 1983, the purchaser’s solicitors informed the vendor’s solicitors that he did not wish to complete the purchase and requested for the return of his deposit of 10% of the purchase price. The vendor pointed out that as the 21-day notice had expired and the purchaser still did not intend to complete, his deposit had been forfeited. The vendor then brought an action for the balance of the purchase price with interest or in the alternative damages for breach of contract.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">On 23&nbsp;August 1984, the Collector of Land Revenue awarded $450,000 as compensation for the acquisition and the sum was paid into court. The Collector took possession of the property on 28&nbsp;May 1985 and on 1&nbsp;June 1985, an entry in the Registry of Deeds was made vesting title in the State. The compensation with interest was paid to the vendor pursuant to an order made on 5&nbsp;July 1985 at her instance. The judicial commissioner allowed the vendor’s claim and dismissed the purchaser’s counterclaim for the deposit. The purchaser appealed. The issues in this appeal were: (a)&nbsp;whether the doctrine of frustration was capable of being applied to a contract for the sale of land; (b)&nbsp;if so, whether in this case the agreement was frustrated by the compulsory acquisition of the property under the Act; and (c)&nbsp;whether by reason of the compulsory acquisition the vendor could on completion convey to the purchaser a good title to the property.</p> <p class="HN-Heading">Held, allowing the appeal:</p> <p class="HN-Held">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of frustration was capable of being applied to a contract for the sale of land.

The passing of beneficial ownership to a purchaser of land was premised on the availability of specific performance; if for some reason specific performance was not available then the purchaser was deemed never to have been owner of the land. In this case, as the availability of specific performance was decided only at the time of the proceedings, which was after the date for completion had passed, it could not be said that the contract was not frustrated because the completion date fell prior to the vesting of the title in the State: at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_37">[37]</a>, <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_39">[39]</a>, <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_40">[40]</a> and <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_41">[41]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it was true that acquisition commenced by the s&nbsp;5 declaration was not completed until the various steps prescribed in the Act had taken place and the final step was the entry made in the relevant register under s&nbsp;18 of the Act, in considering whether a contract for the sale of land had been frustrated by compulsory acquisition which had begun, it was not sufficient to have regard purely to such technical aspects of the transaction. Regard must be had to the practical impact the compulsory acquisition had on the land. The process of land acquisition which had started would lead inexorably to the taking of possession of the property by the Collector and the vesting of title thereof in the State. Although in the interim the sale and purchase could be completed, what would be delivered and conveyed to the purchaser would be possession of the property for a limited period and a title which would become defeasible in a matter of one to two years. As the purchaser had bargained not only for the legal estate but for the use of the property, what he would get would be an estate which was “unusable and unsaleable”. The commencement of the process of compulsory acquisition had therefore caused the sale and purchase agreement, if performed, to be a different thing from that contracted for: at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_44">[44]</a> and <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_45">[45]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract may be frustrated as long as it remained executory.

The sale was subject to the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1981 (“the Law Society’s Conditions”) and was also subject to the title of the property being in order and free from encumbrances. Clause&nbsp;4 of the agreement provided that completion should be within eight weeks from the date of exercise of the option. Accordingly the date fixed for completion was 7&nbsp;July 1983.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completion, however, did not take place on the stipulated date. On 13&nbsp;July 1983 the vendor’s solicitors sent to the purchaser’s solicitors a notice to complete within 21&nbsp;days under condition&nbsp;2 of the Law Society’s Conditions. On the same day there was made under s&nbsp;5 of the Land Acquisition Act (Cap&nbsp;272, 1970&nbsp;Ed) (“the Act”) a declaration on behalf of the President of the Republic of Singapore stating that the property was required for a public purpose, <em>viz</em> general redevelopment, and on 19&nbsp;July a notification of the declaration was published in the <em>Government Gazette</em>. For the purpose of this judgment we shall refer to the text and sections of the Act in the 1970 edition. On 1&nbsp;August 1983 the purchaser’s solicitors wrote to the vendor’s solicitors stating, among other things, that in view of the declaration in the <em>Gazette</em> the purchaser did not intend to carry on with the purchase and requested the refund of the 10% deposit. In response the vendor, by her solicitors’ telex dated 5&nbsp;August 1983, stated that the 21-day notice had expired and as the purchaser did not intend to complete, the 10% deposit had been forfeited and she joined issue with the purchaser’s other contentions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7&nbsp;August 1984 the vendor commenced an action against the purchaser claiming the balance of the purchase price plus interest or alternatively damages for breach of contract. The claim was disputed and the purchaser raised, <em>inter alia</em>, two defences which may be summarised as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the agreement without any fault on his part was frustrated by the compulsory acquisition of the property under the Act which was initiated by the declaration under s&nbsp;5 of the Act published on 19&nbsp;July 1982 and the purchaser was thereby discharged from the performance of the agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vendor was precluded by the declaration from giving to the purchaser a good title to the property. The purchaser counterclaimed the refund of the deposit of 10% of the purchase price.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, on 23&nbsp;August 1984 the Collector of Land Revenue awarded a sum of $450,000 as compensation for the acquisition and the amount was paid into court. Possession of the property was taken by the Collector on 28&nbsp;May 1985 under s&nbsp;16 of the Act. Following that on 1&nbsp;June 1985 an entry in the Registry of Deeds was made pursuant to s&nbsp;18 of the Act. The amount of compensation with interest was subsequently paid out to the vendor pursuant to an order made on 5&nbsp;July 1985 at the instance of the vendor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action was tried before the learned judicial commissioner, Mr&nbsp;Michael Hwang. In a reserved judgment, reported in <em>Sheriffa Taibah bte Abdul Rahman v Lim Kim Som</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1992] 1 SLR(R) 0375.xml&#39;)">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 375</a>, he allowed the claim of the vendor and dismissed the counterclaim of the purchaser. So far as relevant to this appeal, his decision, if we may summarise it, is as follows. Under the Act, compulsory acquisition is a process rather than an act, which begins with the declaration under s&nbsp;5 and ends with the entry or notification in the Registry of Deeds or Registry of Titles (as the case may be) under s&nbsp;8. The landowner is not divested of his legal or beneficial interest in the land until after possession has been taken by the Collector under s&nbsp;16 or 17 and the procedures described in s&nbsp;18 have been carried out. It is the entry or notification in the appropriate register under s&nbsp;18 which vests the title in the State. In the instant case, the vendor, as the owner of the property, could complete the sale and convey to the purchaser the title to the property even though a declaration under s&nbsp;5 had been made and published. The declaration under s&nbsp;5 did not deprive the vendor of her interest in the subject land so as to preclude her from completing the sale. Nor did the declaration destroy the subject matter of the agreement. On the question of good title to the property, the learned judicial commissioner held that the declaration under s&nbsp;5 was not an encumbrance on the property and the fact that the property would, shortly after completion, have to be “surrendered” to the State should not affect the validity of the vendor’s title at completion. The effect of the declaration under s&nbsp;5 might be to diminish the value of the property but that did not impeach the vendor’s title. The vendor, therefore, on completion could give a good and marketable title despite the s&nbsp;5 declaration. Against his decision this appeal has been brought.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before us, three main issues have been raised: Firstly, whether the doctrine of frustration is capable of being applied to a contract for the sale of land; secondly, if the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, whether in this case the agreement was frustrated by the compulsory acquisition of the property under the Act; and thirdly, whether by reason of the compulsory acquisition, which had already commenced, the vendor could on completion convey to the purchaser a good title to the property.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether frustration can apply to contract for the sale of land</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent judicial <em>dicta</em> support the view that the doctrine of frustration is capable of being applied to a contract for the sale of land. In <em>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/13145-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1977] 1&nbsp;WLR&nbsp;164</a>, the Court of Appeal in England appeared to have accepted that frustration could apply to such a transaction. That case concerned the sale of a warehouse that had been advertised as suitable for redevelopment. During the negotiations the purchasers had been informed by the vendors that the property had not been designated as a building of “special architectural or historical interest”. The day after the contract was signed, the Department of Environment informed the vendors that the property had been selected for inclusion in the list of buildings of “special architectural or historic interest” pursuant to s&nbsp;54 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. The effect of this was that obtaining planning permission would become more difficult and complicated. One of the arguments raised on behalf of the purchasers was that the contract had been frustrated by the inclusion of the property in the statutory list of buildings of “special architectural or historic interest”. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the contract had not been so frustrated. Buckley&nbsp;LJ stated thus, at 173:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am prepared to assume for the purpose of this judgment that the law relating to frustration of contracts is capable of being applied in the case of a contract for the sale of land, though that is one of the matters which has been debated before us.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judge then held that there was no factual basis for holding that the contract had been frustrated. He said, at 173:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I have reached the conclusion that there are not here the necessary factual bases for holding that this contract has been frustrated. It seems to me that the risk of property being listed as property of architectural or historical interest is a risk which inheres in all ownership of buildings. In many cases it may be an extremely remote risk. In many cases it may be a marginal risk. In some cases it may be a substantial risk. But it is a risk, I think, which attaches to all buildings and it is a risk that every owner and every purchaser of property must recognize that he is subject to. The purchasers in the present case bought knowing that they would have to obtain planning permission in order to develop the property. The effect of listing under the sections of the Act to which I have referred makes the obtaining of planning permission, it may be, more difficult, and it may also make it a longer and more complicated process. But still, in essence, the position is that the would-be developer has to obtain the appropriate planning permissions, one form of permission being the ‘listed building permission’.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judge held that the purchasers must be taken to have known that there was the risk that the building might at some time be listed. He continued, at 173–174:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">But, in my judgment, this is a risk of a kind which every purchaser should be regarded as knowing that he is subject to when he enters into his contract of purchase. It is a risk which I think the purchaser must carry, and any loss that may result from the maturing of that risk is a loss which must lie where it falls. Moreover, the purchasers have not yet established that they will be unable to obtain all the necessary planning permissions, including ‘listed building permission’. So it has not yet, I think, been established that the listing of this building has had the drastic effect which the figures which I have mentioned suggest that it may have had. It may well turn out to be the case that ‘listed building permission’ will be obtainable here and the purchasers will be able to carry out the development which they desire to carry into effect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To similar effect was the judgment of Lawton&nbsp;LJ. He said at 175:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anybody who buys property knows, and certainly those who buy property as property developers know, that there are all kinds of hazards which have to be taken into consideration. There is the obvious hazard of planning permission … Amongst the hazards are the provisions of s&nbsp;54 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. That seems now to be a well-known hazard, as is shown by the form of inquiry before contract which was made by the purchasers in this case. They used a printed form. The printed form asked whether the property had been listed. Similarly when they came to make a search in the local registry of land charges, once again they made specific inquiries as to whether there had been any listing of the premises. All that adds up, in my judgment, to indicating that those who deal in property nowadays appreciate the existence of these kind of risks.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, he continued:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence in this case was that the purchasers have a strong case for getting planning permission; and, if that be so, how can it be said at this time that the contract for the purchase of the land has been frustrated? Like Buckley&nbsp;LJ, I assume that the doctrine of frustration does apply to a contract for the purchase of real property. There is still, I should have thought, opportunity for the purchasers of this warehouse to get the planning permission which they want.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in <em>Universal Corporation v Five Ways Properties Ltd</em> [1979] 1&nbsp;All ER&nbsp;552, the Court of Appeal accepted that frustration could apply to a contract for the sale of land. It was however not applied as the court was of the view that the unavailability of funds to the purchaser at the date of completion caused by exchange control legislation in Nigeria could not frustrate the contract. Buckley&nbsp;LJ said at 554:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Certainly the plaintiff was unable, by reason of matters beyond its control, to complete the contract when it should have done so, but this is something quite different from the contract having become incapable of performance; nor, in my view, can it be suggested that anything had happened to make the performance of the contract, in the circumstances existing at the date for completion, significantly different from what was contracted for: see <em>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/63059-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] AC&nbsp;696</a> at 729. On the material before the court, in my judgment, no frustration is shown to have occurred.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of <em>Wong Lai Ying v Chinachem Investment Co Ltd</em> (1979)&nbsp;13&nbsp;BLR&nbsp;81 the doctrine of frustration was applied to contracts for sale of flats. In that case, the plaintiffs as the vendors, under 24&nbsp;contracts made with 24&nbsp;purchasers sold to them a flat each. The 24&nbsp;flats were to be comprised in two tower blocks to be built by the plaintiff at a mid-level site in Hong Kong Island. Completion was fixed for 17&nbsp;May 1973 but the date could be extended up to one year. On 18&nbsp;June 1972 part of the hillside near the Po Shan Road above the site slipped taking with it a block of flats of 13&nbsp;storeys the debris of which together with many hundred tons of earth landed on the site oblitering [<em>sic</em>] the building works already completed and causing the death of 67&nbsp;people. It was accepted that the landslip was an unforeseeable natural disaster. It was found that the landslip was a frustrating event, and both the Hong Kong Court of Appeal and the Privy Council held that the particular clause in the contracts relied upon by the purchasers did not make provision “for an event causing the circumstances of performance to be radically different from that undertaken by the contract” and accordingly the 24&nbsp;contracts for the sale of the flats were frustrated and the plaintiffs were discharged from performance thereof. Lord&nbsp;Scarman delivering the judgment of the Board concluded thus, at 95–96:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Lord&nbsp;Denning&nbsp;MR remarked in <em>The Eugenia supra</em> (p&nbsp;239), frustration is a common law doctrine designed to achieve justice where it would be ‘positively unjust to hold the parties bound’. On the facts as found concurrently by the trial judge and Court of Appeal it would be unjust to hold the parties bound. It would be requiring the contractor ‘to submit to an aleatory bargain to which he had not agreed’, as Lord&nbsp;Dunedin put it in the <em>Metropolitan Water Board</em> case at p&nbsp;128.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67566-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1981] AC&nbsp;675</a>, a warehouse was demised to the defendants for ten years. The only vehicular access to the warehouse was by a street. After the lease had run for about five years the local authority at a certain point in time closed the street because of the dangerous condition of a derelict Victorian warehouse opposite the warehouse demised to the defendants. The closure was likely to last for 20&nbsp;months and during this period the warehouse of the defendants was rendered useless to the defendants. In an action by the plaintiffs for recovery of rent the defendants counterclaimed that the lease had been frustrated by the events that had happened. In proceedings for summary judgment, both the master and Sheen&nbsp;J on the basis of the decision in <em>Leightons Investment Trust, Limited v Cricklewood Property and Investment Trust, Limited</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/59779-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1943] 1&nbsp;KB&nbsp;493</a> held that a lease could not be the subject of frustration. Judgment was accordingly entered against the defendants. However, Sheen&nbsp;J granted the defendants a certificate under s&nbsp;12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969 for an appeal direct to the House of Lords and the appeal came before the House. It was there held that the doctrine of frustration was in principle applicable to a lease but on the facts the lease was not frustrated. Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce in his speech said, at 697:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In my opinion, therefore, though such cases may be rare, the doctrine of frustration is capable of application to leases of land. It must be so applied with proper regard to the fact that a lease, that is, a grant of legal estate, is involved. The court must consider whether any term is to be implied which would determine the lease in the event which has happened and/or ascertain the foundation of the agreement and decide whether this still exists in the light of the terms of the lease, the surrounding circumstances and any special rules which apply to leases or to the particular lease in question.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he held that the temporary nature of the interruption did not approach “the gravity of a frustrating event”. He said, at 697–698:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Out of ten years it will have lost under two years of use: there will be nearly three years left after the interruption has ceased. This is a case, similar to the others, where the likely continuance of the term after the interruption makes it impossible for the lessee to contend that the lease has been brought to an end.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;Simon of Glaisdale in more assertive terms said at 705:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can for myself see nothing about the fact of creation of an estate or interest in land which repels the doctrine of frustration. It cannot be that land, being relatively indestructible, is different from any other subject of agreement: that would perhaps make a lease so much the less likely to be frustrated in fact, but would not constitute inherent repugnance of the doctrine. In any case, we are concerned with legal interests in the land rather than the land itself. It cannot be because a lease operates <em>in rem</em>: so, for example, does a contract for seamen’s wages, since that gives rise to a maritime lien, yet can presumably like other contracts for personal services be frustrated by ill health or death. Moreover, the criterion of operation <em>in rem</em> hardly matches counsel’s first submission on agreements for a lease, which operate <em>in personam</em>. It cannot be because, once vested, a lease cannot be divested except by agreement of the parties. That would be to beg the question: if frustration applies, it can be so divested. Moreover, as I have tried to demonstrate, quite apart from frustration it can be so divested by operation of law in the doctrine of denial of title. And, as my noble and learned friend, Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce, has pointed out, there is nothing illogical in implying a term in a lease that it shall be discharged on the occurrence of a frustrating event. Nor, finally, is it realistic to argue that on execution of the lease the lessee got all that he bargained for. The reality is that this lessee, for example, bargained, not for a term of years, but for the use of a warehouse owned by the lessor – just as a demise charterer bargains for the use of the ship.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the case concerned a lease and not a contract for the sale of land, Lord&nbsp;Simon made clear that frustration could apply to any contract that remained executory. He continued thus, at 705:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I turn, then, to the second main contention – namely, that the risk of unforeseen mischance passes irrevocably to the lessee at the moment of conveyance. This, too, begs the question whether the doctrine of frustration applies to leaseholds. If it does, such risk does not pass in all circumstances. Moreover, the sale of land is a false analogy. A fully executed contract cannot be frustrated; and a sale of land is characteristically such a contract. But a lease is partly executory: rights and obligations remain outstanding on both sides throughout its currency. Even a partly executed contract is susceptible of frustration is so far as it remains executory: there are many such cases in the books.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This later passage illustrates that until a contract is fully discharged by completion frustration is possible. To argue that an estate has passed and with it the risk “begs the question”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Canadian case, <em>Capital Quality Homes Ltd v Colwyn Construction Ltd</em> (1975) 61&nbsp;DLR&nbsp;(3d)&nbsp;385, the Ontario Court of Appeal applied the doctrine of frustration to a contract for the sale of land and held that that contract had been frustrated by supervening legislation. There, the plaintiff agreed to purchase 26 building lots from the defendant. The vendor was aware of his intention to erect homes on each lot and selling each by separate conveyance. Legislation came into force shortly before the completion date which in certain circumstances restricted an owner’s right to convey, and made necessary the obtaining of consent from the relevant committee of adjustment designated in the legislation. The vendor was by the legislation precluded from conveying the 26 building lots in 26 separate deeds without proper consent, and while conveying the 26 lots to the purchaser would be possible, the latter would be unable to reconvey individual building lots to prospective home buyers as it had intended without complying with the restrictive provisions of the new legislation. The court held that the contract had been frustrated. Evans&nbsp;JA, giving the judgment of the court, distinguished the case of <em>Hillingdon Estates Co v Stonefield Estates Ld</em> [1952] Ch&nbsp;627 (to which we shall refer in a moment) and stated at 395:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If the supervening event makes the contract incapable of fulfilment as contemplated between the parties, then it appears to me illogical and unreasonable to contend that the fundamental object of the contract can be effected because the equitable interest in the land has passed to the purchaser.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held that there was no binding authority precluding the application of frustration to a contract for the sale of land. He said, at 397:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I adopt the reasoning of Lord&nbsp;Simon in <em>Cricklewood v Leighton’s</em>, <em>supra</em>, and accept his conclusion that there is no binding authority in England precluding the application of the doctrine of frustration to contracts involving a lease of land. I believe the situation to be the same in Ontario and I am unable to distinguish any difference between leases of land and agreements for the sale of land, so far as the application of the doctrine is concerned. Each is more than a simple contract. In the former an estate in land is created while in the latter an equitable estate arises. There does not appear to be any logical reason or binding legal authority which would prohibit the extension of the doctrine to contracts involving land.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he rationalised the law thus, at 398:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the factual situation is such that there is a clear ‘frustration of the common venture’ then the contract, whether it is a contract for the sale of land or otherwise, is at an end and the parties are discharged from further performance and the adjustment of the rights and liabilities of the parties are left to be determined under the <em>Frustrated Contracts Act</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the doctrine of frustration is not limited in its application to circumstances where the supervening event destroys or render non-existence the subject matter of the contract. In other words, non-existence of the subject matter of the contract is not the only circumstance where frustration can occur. There may well be “such a change in the significance of the obligation” to justify frustration; for instance, there may be what is commonly referred to as a “frustration of purpose”. In <em>Krell v Henry</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/45848-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/45848-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1903]&nbsp;2&nbsp;KB&nbsp;740</a> the defendant hired a flat in Pall Mall for the days on which the processions planned for the coronation of Edward&nbsp;VII were to take place. His object, though not expressly stated in the contract, was to watch the processions. When the processions were postponed the contract was held to be frustrated. Performance was not physically impossible; the defendant could still have used the flat on the days in question but the purpose or object of the contract no longer existed. Vaughan Williams&nbsp;LJ explained thus at 748:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever may have been the limits of the Roman law, the case of <em>Nickoll v Ashton</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/44738-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1901] 2&nbsp;KB&nbsp;126</a> makes it plain that the English law applies the principle not only to cases where the performance of the contract becomes impossible by the cessation of existence of the thing which is the subject-matter of the contract, but also to cases where the event which renders the contract incapable of performance is the cessation or non-existence of an express condition or state of things, going to the root of the contract, and essential to its performance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle of contract law applies equally in contracts for the sale of land. It will be recalled that in <em>Capital Quality Homes v Colwyn Construction Ltd</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_19">[19]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) Evans&nbsp;JA expressly decided on the ground that the facts showed “frustration of a common venture”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our judgment, on the authorities which we have considered, frustration is capable of being applied to a contract for the sale of land. We can find nothing in principle that “repels” the application of the doctrine of frustration to such contracts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether frustration applies on the facts of the case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to the next question: whether frustration applies on the facts of the instant case. In this connection, it is necessary to bear in mind the test applicable in determining whether or not frustration has occurred. The test for frustration was rationalised by the House of Lords in <em>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/63059-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] AC&nbsp;696</a>. There, the contractors were under an obligation to build 78 houses for a local authority for a fixed sum within a period of eight months. Owing to unexpected circumstances, in the absence of fault on the part of either party, adequate supplies of labour were not available. The House of Lords held that the contract had not been frustrated and that although the turn of events rendered the contract more onerous, it could not relieve the parties of the agreement they had made. Lord&nbsp;Reid on 720–721 said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears to me that frustration depends, at least in most cases, not on adding any implied term, but on the true construction of the terms which are in the contract read in light of the nature of the contract and of the relevant surrounding circumstances when the contract was made. There is much authority for this view.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Lordship then referred to the following passage of the speech of Viscount&nbsp;Simon in <em>British Movietonews Ld v London and District Cinemas Ld</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/62161-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/62161-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1952]&nbsp;AC&nbsp;166</a> at 185:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">If, on the other hand, a consideration of the terms of the contract, in the light of the circumstances existing when it was made, shows that they never agreed to be bound in a fundamentally different situation which has now unexpectedly emerged, the contract ceases to bind at that point – not because the court in its discretion thinks it just and reasonable to qualify the terms of the contract, but because on its true construction it does not apply in that situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1">and concluded thus, at 721:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On this view there is no need to consider what the parties thought or how they or reasonable men in their shoes would have dealt with the new situation if they had foreseen it. The question is whether the contract which they did make is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;Radcliffe formulated the test for frustration in these terms at 728–729:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The legal effect of frustration ‘does not depend on their intention or their opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event’. On the contrary, it seems that when the event occurs ‘the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence’ (<em>Dahl v Nelson</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/30581-E-M.xml&#39;)">(1886) 6&nbsp;App Cas&nbsp;38</a>, <em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Watson).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… So perhaps it would be simpler to say at the outset that frustration occurs whenever the law recognizes that without default of either party a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. <em>Non haec in foedera veni</em>. It was not this that I promised to do.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Lordship then dealt with the question as to how the court should proceed in determining whether or not there was frustration. He said, at 729:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, however, no uncertainty as to the materials upon which the court must proceed. ‘The data for decision are, on the one hand, the terms and construction of the contract, read in the light of the existing circumstances, and on the other hand the events which have occurred’ (<em>Denny Mott &amp; Dickson Ltd v James B Fraser &amp; Co Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/60131-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/60131-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1944] AC&nbsp;265</a>, 274–275 <em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Wright). In the nature of things there is often no room for any elaborate inquiry. The court must act upon a general impression of what its rule requires. It is for that reason that special importance is necessarily attached to the occurrence of any unexpected event that, as it were, changes the face of things. But even so, it is not hardship or inconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principle of frustration into play. There must be as well such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the test propounded in <em>Davis Contractors Ltd</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>), we now focus on: (a)&nbsp;the terms and conditions of the contract made between the parties read in the light of the nature of the contract and the surrounding circumstances; and (b)&nbsp;the event supervening, and consider whether the agreement is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation, or (putting it in another way) whether the unexpected event that occurred has changed “the face of things”. Each case turns upon its own specific facts (<em>Pioneer Shipping Ltd v BTP Tioxide Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67719-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1982] AC&nbsp;724</a> at 752 <em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Roskill). In this case, the agreement apart from a few special conditions incorporated the Law Society’s Conditions of Sale. Clause&nbsp;5 of the agreement deals with the issue of legal requisitions:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The sale and purchase herein is subject to satisfactory replies to legal requisitions filed with the various government departments. Provided always that any outstanding property tax or other charges which are capable of being paid and discharged on or before completion or any outstanding notice which is capable of being complied with on or before completion or any road, drainage, sewerage or government scheme which does not adversely affect the property shall not be construed as unsatisfactory and the purchaser shall be bound to complete the purchase in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions herein contained. Subject to the above, if the answers to any requisitions are unsatisfactory, the purchaser may annul the sale in which event, all moneys paid to the vendor to account of the purchase price herein (including the option money) shall be refunded to the purchaser forthwith free of interest and neither party shall have any claim or lien against the other whatsoever thereafter, provided further that in the event any replies shall not be received by the date fixed for completion, the same shall be deemed satisfactory.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not cover the present situation and the question of land acquisition was not provided for in this clause. At any rate it has not been argued before us that this clause contemplates the situation of compulsory acquisition of land; counsel for the respondent certainly did not rely on this clause in his argument. Clause&nbsp;7 provides for late completion. It stipulates that the interest for late completion should be 12% instead of the 10% provided for by the Law Society’s Conditions of Sale. Clause&nbsp;15 deals with government improvements:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The property is sold subject to any government road, back lane or other improvement scheme whatever affecting the same, whether mentioned in the particulars or not, and the purchaser shall be deemed to have full knowledge of the nature and effect thereof, and shall make no objection or requisition in respect thereof.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again this clause does not cover compulsory land acquisition by the Government. Clause&nbsp;9 deals with the physical state and condition of the property; it provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purchaser shall be deemed to have notice of the actual state and condition of the property as regards access, repair, light, air, drainage and in all other respects.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement therefore has not provided for the event of compulsory land acquisition. From the nature of the property the purchaser obviously purchased it for a commercial purpose. It was obviously not contemplated that compulsory acquisition by the Government would occur. There was no indication known to the purchaser on which he ought to have known that such an event would take place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We next turn to the supervening event or more accurately the process of compulsory acquisition of the property that had occurred. In this respect, it is necessary to examine the material provisions of the Land Acquisition Act governing the machinery of such acquisition and consider their effect on a property subject to acquisition. Where the Government has decided that any particular piece of land is needed for public purpose, a declaration under s&nbsp;5 of the Act is made. Section&nbsp;5, so far as material, provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any particular land is needed —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(<em>a</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">for any public purpose;</span></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(<em>b</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">by any person, corporation or statutory board, for any work or an undertaking which, in the opinion of the Minister, is of public benefit or of public utility or in the public interest; or</span></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(<em>c</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">for any residential, commercial or industrial purposes,</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">the President may, by notification published in the <em>Gazette</em>, declare the land to be required for the purpose specified in the notification.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notification shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein as provided in subsection&nbsp;(1).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the notification of such declaration is published, the Collector of Land Revenue (“the Collector”) is directed “to take proceedings for the acquisition of the land”: see s&nbsp;6. The Collector then proceeds to cause the land to be marked out and measured and gives notice to parties interested and invites claims for compensation. Subsequently at an appropriate date he holds an enquiry and after considering the claims makes an award of compensation to the parties concerned. The procedures for these are set out in ss&nbsp;6 to 16 of the Act. After the Collector has made the award under s&nbsp;10, he may under s&nbsp;16 take possession of the land. Once possession has been taken the State is not at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of the land. Under s&nbsp;18 the Collector “immediately upon taking possession” shall give notice to the Registrar of Deeds or lodge an instrument with the Registrar of Titles who shall make an entry or notification in the appropriate register (as the case may be) and thereafter “the land shall vest in the State free from encumbrances”. We agree with the learned judicial commissioner that in Singapore compulsory acquisition of land under the Act is a process rather than an act, and it begins with the declaration under s&nbsp;5 and ends with the entry or notification under s&nbsp;18; we also agree with him that the legal title to a property acquired vests in the State only upon the procedures prescribed by s&nbsp;18 being completed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judicial commissioner dealt at great length with the question whether a compulsory acquisition of land by an authority can frustrate a contract for the sale of land and considered various Australian and Indian cases relating to such question. He found that the Australian and Indian legislation on compulsory acquisition are materially different from our Land Acquisition Act and therefore held, and in our view, rightly, that those cases could not apply in the instant case. However, the case which the learned judicial commissioner considered in depth and upon which he relied to a certain extent in arriving at his decision is the English case of <em>Hillingdon Estates v Stonefield Estates</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_19">[19]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) which appears to be the only authority in England bearing on this question. In that case, the vendors contracted in 1938 to sell their land in two portions. The purchasers paid the deposit on both portions and completed the purchase of the first portion. The completion of the second was delayed by, among other things, the outbreak of the war. In 1948 (<em>ie</em> about ten years after the date of the contract) the local authority made a compulsory purchase order affecting, among other land, all of the second portion and the purchase was never completed. The purchasers ultimately paid interest on the purchase price from 1939 to 1949. In 1949 the local authority gave the purchasers and the vendors notice of the order and served on them notices to treat. The purchasers brought an action claiming a declaration that they were discharged from liability under the contract and the return of the interest they had paid. The vendors counterclaimed specific performance of the contract. Vaisey&nbsp;J dismissed the claim and allowed the counterclaim. Vaisey&nbsp;J said, at 631–632:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is the effect of the compulsory purchase order on the rights and position of, first, the purchasers, and, secondly, the vendors? Undoubtedly the position of the vendors in an unperformed contract for the sale of land is radically different, in quality and in nature, from that of the purchasers. I have always understood (and indeed it is a common-place) that when there is a contract by A to sell land to B at a certain price, B becomes the owner in equity of the land, subject, of course, to his obligation to perform his part of the contract by paying the purchase-money; but subject to that, the land is the land of B, the purchaser. What is the position of A, the vendor? He has, it is true, the legal estate in the land, but, for many purposes, from the moment the contract is entered into he holds as trustee for B, the purchaser. True, he has certain rights in the land remaining, but all those rights are conditioned and limited by the circumstances that they are all referable to his right to recover and receive the purchase money. His interest in the land when he has entered into a contract for sale is not an interest in the land; it is an interest in personal estate, in a sum of money; and it seems to me that in a case such as this, when the date for completion is long past, the purchasers, subject to the payment of that purchase-money, are to be regarded as the owners of the land.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the learned judge said, at 633:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree that this compulsory purchase order very much altered the situation, but I cannot appreciate that it has altered it in such a fundamental and catastrophic manner as to justify the court in holding that the whole contract has been frustrated. I see no objection at all to the contract being completed by conveyance after the notice to treat has been served, or indeed at any time, even today. The land could have been conveyed on the purchase-money being paid by the purchasers to the vendors. It would have to be conveyed, I think, subject to the restrictive covenants; but how far anyone in the future is going to have the right to enforce those covenants, I neither know nor pause to inquire. It would also have to be made subject to the compulsory purchase, which would put the purchasers in exactly the same position <em>vis-à-vis</em> the authority as they would have been in had they completed the contract within a reasonable time after the completion date …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis on which Vaisey&nbsp;J held that frustration was not applicable to a contract for the sale of land was that as from the date of the contract the purchaser becomes the beneficial owner of the property subject to the payment of the purchase money and that the vendor’s interest is in the purchase money and he has no interest in the land. Applying the mechanics of compulsory purchase to the case before him, the learned judge found that it was the purchasers who were the owners of the land and who were the party to “the notional contract” with the acquiring authority and the vendors were unconcerned with it. With respect, we do not think that the passing of beneficial ownership to the purchaser is a sufficient answer to the question why frustration cannot apply to a contract for the sale of land. In <em>Barnsley’s Conveyancing Law And Practice</em> (3rd&nbsp;Ed) at p&nbsp;227, Professor&nbsp;Barnsley said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is sometimes said that the beneficial ownership passes the moment the contract is entered into. This may be a satisfactory way of applying the doctrine of conversion in a succession case where the contest is between different claimants to a deceased vendor’s estate. But it is something of an over-simplification in a vendor-purchaser context. The peculiar post-contract relationship between the parties is subject to the contract being eventually performed; if the contract is not performed the relation is discharged and the vendor is treated as never being a trustee for the purchaser.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Australian case of <em>Austin v Sheldon</em> [1974] 2&nbsp;NSWLR&nbsp;661 at 670 Mahoney&nbsp;J succinctly said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… to say that such a purchaser is the owner of the land in equity is correct only in a limited sense. Equity will so regard the purchaser only if and in so far as equity would grant specific performance of the particular contract …</p> <p class="Judg-1">and cited various authorities in support. Later he said at 672 thus:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, this equitable doctrine looks to the rights of the parties on the assumption that the contract of sale will be completed by conveyance. Thus, if it is, for reasons not involving the fault of either party, not completed, the parties’ rights in many respects are to be determined on the basis that the vendor has always been the full owner of the property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a learned writer in an article said in <em>The Conveyancer</em> [1984] at p&nbsp;49, to maintain that frustration cannot occur because the beneficial interest in the land has passed to the purchaser is somewhat of a circular argument. The passing of the beneficial ownership to a purchaser of land is premised on the availability of specific performance, as equity looks upon as done what has been agreed to be done and the purchaser is deemed the owner in equity as of the date of contract.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for any reason specific performance is not available then the purchaser is deemed never to have been owner of the land. In a normal case, specific performance is ordered of a contract for the sale of land as damages are deemed not to be an adequate remedy (<em>Adderley v Dixon</em> (1824) 1&nbsp;Sim &amp; St&nbsp;607 at 610). However, specific performance is not ordered of a contract that is impossible of performance (<em>Ferguson v Wilson</em> (1866) LR&nbsp;2&nbsp;Ch App&nbsp;77). Consistently with this, specific performance is also not to be ordered of a frustrated contract. In the instant case, the learned judicial commissioner did not rely on the passing of the beneficial ownership as the basis for finding that the agreement had not been frustrated. He expressed no opinion on Vaisey&nbsp;J’s basis that as from the date of the contract of sale the purchaser has become the beneficial owner of the property. He said (<a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1992] 1 SLR(R) 0375.xml&#39;)">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 375</a>) at [64] of his judgment:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In arriving at this interpretation, I must make it clear to what extent I rely on <em>Hillingdon</em> ([18]&nbsp;<em>supra</em>), since the English compulsory acquisition legislation is not identical to that of Singapore. <em>Hillingdon</em> is of no direct assistance to me in determining the effect of a s&nbsp;5 declaration under the Singapore Act. However, given that in England, title to the subject land does not vest in the acquiring authority until the stage of conveyance or deed poll, it is easy to arrive at a similar result in Singapore as was reached in <em>Hillingdon</em>, although not necessarily by the same route. <em>Hillingdon</em> decides that, where the date fixed for completion falls prior to title vesting in the acquiring authority, the vendor is, nonetheless, able to convey his interest to the purchaser and the contract is not frustrated by the fact of acquisition, and, to that extent, I find the case of assistance (particularly the passage at 633 I quoted earlier). I am conscious, however, that the passage at 632 of the judgment of Vaisey&nbsp;J dealing with the effect of a contract for sale on the passing of beneficial ownership between vendor and purchaser is not accepted as accurate in some quarters in Australia (see <em>SJR Investment</em> ([24]&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at 213, and <em>Austin v Sheldon</em> [1974] 2&nbsp;NSWLR 661 at 669–672).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of the learned judicial commissioner’s decision was quite simply that the date fixed for completion fell prior to the Collector taking possession of the property and the vesting of the title thereof in the State, and that as of that date the vendor was able to convey the land to the purchaser and accordingly the agreement was not frustrated by the fact of compulsory acquisition. He relied on that passage of the judgment of Vaisey&nbsp;J in <em>Hillingdon</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_19">[19]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at 633. However, it should be borne in mind that since the availability of specific performance is decided only at the time of the proceedings: <em>Price v Strange</em> [1978] Ch&nbsp;337, which is invariably after the date for completion has passed, it is too simplistic to say that the contract was not frustrated because the date fixed for completion fell prior to the vesting of the title in the State.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the learned judicial commissioner that a declaration made under s&nbsp;5 of the Act in respect of any land to be acquired does not vest the title thereto in the State and the title only vests when the entry or notification is made in the relevant register under s&nbsp;18. However, once a declaration is made the process of acquisition has started and its progress will lead almost with absolute certainty to divesting the owner of his title to the land and vesting it in the State. On this point, it is helpful to refer to the leading case of <em>Robinson &amp; Co Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1979-1980] SLR(R) 0483.xml&#39;)">[1979–1980] SLR(R) 483</a>. There, the building at Raffles Place, which housed the Robinson’s departmental store, was destroyed by fire on 21&nbsp;November 1972. About two months later, on 16&nbsp;January 1973, the President of the Republic of Singapore made a declaration under s&nbsp;5 of the Act. Thereafter an inquiry was held by the Collector and an award was made. In making the award the Collector applied the provisos to s&nbsp;33(1) of the Act. The provisions of the subsection and the proviso, so far as relevant, are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">33(1)&nbsp;In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land acquired under this Act, the Board shall take into consideration the following matters and no others, namely —</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that in the case of an acquisition for any purpose specified in subsection&nbsp;(1) of section&nbsp;5 of this Act of any land devastated or affected directly or indirectly by fire, … the Board shall not, in the case of any such acquisition within a period of six months of the land being devastated or affected as aforesaid, take into consideration the matters set out in paragraphs (<em>a</em>) and (<em>e</em>) of this subsection but shall instead consider the market value of the land immediately before it was devastated or affected as aforesaid …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And provided further that the market value of such land shall not exceed one-third of the value of such land had it been vacant land not subject to any such encumbrances, tenancies or occupation by squatters unless the Minister in his discretion, by notification in the <em>Gazette</em>, specifies otherwise.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues raised was whether there had been an “acquisition” of the land within six months of the land being devastated by fire. This court held that once the declaration under s&nbsp;5 was made the acquisition of the land commenced, and this was upheld by the Privy Council. After dealing with the scheme of the Act and the purpose of s&nbsp;33, Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce in delivering the judgment of the Board said at [11]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal decided this issue in favour of the respondent and, on the whole, their Lordships agree. Once the machinery for acquisition has started to operate, which it has under s&nbsp;5, then, subject to the power to withdraw, the owner of the land, who, it is important to observe has no right to object to the acquisition, has an interest only in compensation. To accept this earlier stage as that from which acquisition is to start, accords with the policy of s&nbsp;33, and presents the lesser difficulties in practical operation. Their Lordships are, on this point, in favour of the respondent, being of opinion that the operation of s&nbsp;5 is the critical date.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering when “acquisition” took place for the purpose of s&nbsp;33(1) both this court and the Privy Council considered not only the technical aspect of the Act but also the practical effect the Act has on the property in question. Once a declaration under s&nbsp;5 is made the process of acquisition has commenced and in effect the Government is then acquiring the property in question. It is true that Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce’s <em>dictum</em> that the owner of the land has no right to object to the acquisition and the owner’s interest is only in the compensation was said by the way and was clearly <em>obiter</em>. But what he said is factually and legally correct, and we respectfully adopt it. There is no way an owner of the subject land can object to the acquisition, and there is no way he can take any steps to prevent the progress of the machinery of acquisition. His only interest then is how much he would get as compensation for the acquisition of his land. His very slim hope – it is more wishful thinking than hope – is that before the Government takes possession of the subject land it would withdraw the acquisition. In our experience, there has hardly ever been a case where after the publication of the s&nbsp;5 declaration the Government has withdrawn the acquisition. It is true that the acquisition commenced by the s&nbsp;5 declaration is not completed until the various steps prescribed in the Act have been taken and the final step in this process is the entry or notification made in the relevant register under s&nbsp;18 of the Act. Technically until this finale takes place, the owner retains the title to the land and is able to transfer his title to the purchaser and until possession is taken by the Collector the owner is also able to give possession of the land to the purchaser. However, in considering whether a contract for the sale of land has been frustrated by compulsory acquisition which has begun, it is not sufficient to have regard purely to such technical aspects of the transaction. Regard must be had to the practical impact the compulsory acquisition has on the land. Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce in <em>National Carriers</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_14">[14]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at&nbsp;694–695, in disposing of the argument that a lease could not be frustrated because the leasehold estate had passed said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the second place, if the argument is to have any reality, it must be possible to say that frustration of leases cannot occur because in any event the tenant will have that which he bargained for, namely, the leasehold estate. Certainly this may be so in many cases … But there may also be cases where this is not so. A man may desire possession and use of land or buildings for, and only for, some purpose in view and mutually contemplated. Why is it an answer, when he claims that this purpose is ‘frustrated’, to say that he has an estate if that estate is unusable and unsaleable? In such a case the lease, or the conferring of an estate, is a subsidiary means to an end, not an aim or end of itself. This possible situation is figured, in fact, by Viscount&nbsp;Simon&nbsp;LC in the <em>Cricklewood</em> case <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/71838-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1945] AC&nbsp;221</a>, 229.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to the facts in the instant case, the declaration under s&nbsp;5 was published on 19&nbsp;July 1983. As of that date the agreement was still in existence, although the contractual date of completion had elapsed and the vendor had served on the purchaser the 21-day notice to complete the transaction. The vendor still had possession and title to the property and could complete the transaction, namely, delivery of vacant possession and conveyance of the legal title to the purchaser on the date stated in the 21-day notice. But, has the position <em>vis-à-vis</em> the property not been fundamentally altered? The Government was then in the process of acquiring the property. The vendor who was still the legal owner of the property had no right to object to the acquisition and her only right <em>vis-à-vis</em> the acquisition was only to the compensation that would be awarded. The process of land acquisition which had started would lead inexorably to the taking of possession of the property by the Collector and the vesting of the title thereof in the State. Although in the interim, the sale and purchase could be completed, what would be delivered and conveyed to the purchaser would be possession of the property for a limited period and a title which would become defeasible in a matter of one to two years or thereabouts. In the words of Lord&nbsp;Simon of Glaisdale, the reality is that the purchaser had bargained not only for the legal estate but for the use of the property. What he would get would be an estate which was “unusable and unsaleable”. What was even more catastrophic in this case was that the purchaser would receive as compensation for the land he had purchased (if he had completed the purchase) a sum representing the value as determined under the Act which was far below the market value of the property. Giving some sense of reality to the whole situation it cannot truly be said that the purchaser would on completion get what he had bargained for. In our judgment, (adopting the words of Lord&nbsp;Radcliffe in <em>Davis Contractors</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at 729) the occurrence of the unexpected event, <em>ie</em> the commencement of the process of compulsory acquisition, had altered fundamentally the “face of things” and there was such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for. In our judgment, this case is an appropriate one for the invocation of the doctrine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remain two objections made by counsel for the respondent. The first was that the purchaser had been at fault in delaying completion. If he had completed the contract on the date fixed for completion the contract would have been fully discharged and any contention of frustration would be spurious. Whilst such delay was fortuitous from the viewpoint of the purchaser, as long as the contract remained executory it could be frustrated. Breach by the purchaser can only prevent frustration where there is a causal link between the breach and the event which is alleged to be frustrating. This can be illustrated by the case of <em>F&nbsp;C Shepherd &amp; Co Ltd v Jerrom</em> [1986] 3&nbsp;All ER&nbsp;589 where it was held that an apprentice’s conviction for affray and conspiracy to assault and consequent borstal term frustrated his contract of employment. One of the grounds raised by Lawton&nbsp;LJ whilst rejecting the argument that such frustration had been self-induced was that his conduct though deliberate did not by itself affect the performance of the contract; it was the act of the tribunal in sentencing him to the borstal term. Recently in <em>The Super Servant Two</em> [1990] 1&nbsp;Lloyd’s Rep&nbsp;1 at 10, Bingham&nbsp;LJ formulated what he termed the “real question” as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whether the frustrating event relied upon is truly an outside event or extraneous change of situation or whether it is an event which the party seeking to rely on it had the means and opportunity to prevent but nevertheless caused or permitted to come about … A fine test of legal duty is inappropriate; what is needed is a pragmatic judgment whether a party seeking to rely on an event as discharging him from a contractual promise was himself responsible for the occurrence of that event.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case the defendants had signed a contract which stipulated that performance could be effected by either one of two transportation units, <em>Super Servant One</em> or <em>Super Servant Two</em>. The latter sank and the Court of Appeal held that the defendants could not plead frustration: the defendants could have used <em>Super Servant One</em> to fulfil their obligations but had elected not to do so. The facts of the present case are far removed from those of <em>The Super Servant Two</em>. It cannot be said that the purchaser was in any way responsible for the compulsory acquisition of the property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second of these objections was that compulsory acquisition was a possibility in Singapore in 1983 and should have been foreseen by the purchaser. Counsel submitted that it was common practice at the time amongst purchasers and their advisors to insert a clause allowing the purchaser to resile in the event of intended acquisition and the fact that the appellant had sued his solicitor for negligence in not so doing was proof of this. The relevance of foreseeability to the doctrine of frustration is not free from doubt. Different judges have proffered different views on the subject. Lord&nbsp;Radcliffe, in assessing why the shortage of labour was unable to frustrate a construction contract in <em>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em> at 731), stated that the “possibility of enough labour and shortage of materials not being available was before their very eyes and could have been the subject of special contractual stipulation”. Both Buckley and Lawton&nbsp;LJJ in <em>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_7">[7]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) appeared to have based their judgments partly on the foreseeability of the event which was claimed to have frustrated the contract. In contrast, Goddard&nbsp;J stated in <em>W&nbsp;J Tatem, Limited v Gamboa</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/58690-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/58690-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1939]&nbsp;1&nbsp;KB&nbsp;132</a> at 138 that once “the existence of a certain state of affairs has come to an end, the contract is at an end, that result follows whether or not the event causing it was contemplated by the parties”. Lord&nbsp;Denning&nbsp;MR was of the same mind in <em>The Eugenia</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/64456-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1964] 2&nbsp;QB&nbsp;226</a> at 239, where he said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has frequently been said that the doctrine of frustration only applies when the new situation is ‘unforeseen’ or ‘unexpected’ or ‘uncontemplated’, as if that were an essential feature. But it is not so. The only thing that is essential is that the parties should have made no provision for it in their contract. The only relevance of it being ‘unforeseen’ is this: If the parties did not foresee anything of the kind happening, you can readily infer they have made no provision for it: whereas, if they did foresee it, you would expect them to make provision for it. But cases have occurred where the parties have foreseen the danger ahead, and yet made no provision for it in the contract.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the rigid insistence on the fact that the event ought to have been foreseen cannot be an adequate solution and it would negate the very test propounded by Lord&nbsp;Radcliffe in the <em>Davis Contractors</em> case (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). In <em>Denny, Mott &amp; Dickson, Limited v James B Fraser &amp; Company, Limited</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/60131-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/60131-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1944]&nbsp;AC&nbsp;265</a> at 275 Lord&nbsp;Wright had this to say about the doctrine of frustration:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The doctrine [of frustration] is invented by the court in order to supplement the defects of the actual contract. The parties did not anticipate fully and completely, if at all, or provide for what actually happened. It is not possible, to my mind, to say that, if they had thought of it, they would have said: ‘Well, if that happens, all is over between us.’ On the contrary, they would almost certainly on the one side or the other have sought to introduce reservations or qualifications or compensations. As to that the court cannot guess. What it can say is that the contract either binds or does not bind …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later he referred to what Lord&nbsp;Sumner said in <em>Hirji Mulji v Cheong Yue Steamship Company, Limited</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/55694-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1926] AC&nbsp;497</a> at 510, and said at 276:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In <em>Hirji Mulji</em>’s case, about seven years later, [Lord&nbsp;Sumner’s] analysis is more exact and penetrating, but he again emphasizes that, when frustration occurs, it is automatic, and that its legal effect depends not on the intention of the parties or even on their knowledge as to the event, but on its occurrence in such circumstances as to show it to be inconsistent with the further prosecution of the adventure. I mention these two aspects of the principle here because they are important for the decision of the present case. The event is something which happens in the world of fact, and has to be found as a fact by the judge. Its effect on the contract depends on the meaning of the contract, which is a matter of law. Whether there is frustration or not in any case depends on the view taken of the event and of its relation to the express contract by ‘informed and experienced minds’. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there is no evidence in the present case that the parties actually foresaw that an acquisition might take place. Although a multitude of allegations were raised by both parties at trial, no contentions were made as to any discussion of acquisition or the insertion of a clause to cover its consequences. There was no effort even to negotiate with the vendor to make the sale subject to planning approval, as is normal with contracts of this kind. If there is any evidence that compulsory acquisition was foreseen it would be on the part of the vendor’s agents. Mr&nbsp;Namazie, the solicitor acting for the vendor, was aware of the fire, and had issued instructions to Mrs&nbsp;Lee, the real estate agent, to tell the purchaser that the property was not sold subject to planning permission. The sale was conducted on a “first-come-first-served” basis rather than on a consideration of which buyer offered the better price. Completion was within eight weeks and the interest for delayed completion was higher than that provided by the Law Society’s Conditions. It appears that the vendor was hoping to sell the property to avoid bearing the risk of a possible acquisition.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The effect of frustration</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to the question as to how the Frustrated Contracts Act (Cap&nbsp;115) should apply in this case. Section&nbsp;2(2) thereof provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged (referred to in this Act as the time of discharge) shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid, and, in the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus under s&nbsp;2 the deposit paid to the vendor is recoverable from her, and the proviso which applies only to “expenses incurred” has no application.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether a good title could be conveyed on completion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to the last issue: whether having regard to the process of compulsory acquisition which had been commenced by the declaration under s&nbsp;5 the vendor would on completion be able to convey to the purchaser a good title to the property. On this issue the learned judicial commissioner (<a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1992] 1 SLR(R) 0375.xml&#39;)">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 375</a>) at [95] held that the fact that the property would shortly after completion “have to be surrendered to the State” should not affect the validity of the vendor’s title at completion; that after the s&nbsp;5 declaration there was in this case no legal impediment to carrying out the terms of the agreement and any subsale could have been concluded on the same terms as set out in the agreement provided completion took place before possession had been taken under s&nbsp;16 or s&nbsp;17 and the s&nbsp;18 procedures had been carried out, and that at the date fixed for completion (both under the agreement and the notice to complete) the vendor’s title was free from any challenge and the State could not prevent completion taking place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judicial commissioner referred to the Australian case of <em>Tsekos v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd</em> [1982] 2&nbsp;NSWLR&nbsp;347. In that case the purchaser terminated the contracts for the purchase of three properties on the ground that at the time of the contracts the vendor was aware that the local authority had expressed a “threat of resumption” (<em>ie</em> compulsory acquisition) of the properties. After the contracts were made, the local authority proceeded to acquire the properties, and one of the issues decided by Rath&nbsp;J was the question whether in view of the resumption the vendor could give a good title. He said, at [96]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">… The sale is of an estate in fee simple in possession free from encumbrances (<em>Emmet on Title</em> (17th&nbsp;Ed, 1978) p&nbsp;76), and <em>if the properties had been resumed before the time for completion the defendant could not have given that title: Austin v Sheldon</em>. It should in my opinion be inferred that when the council rejected the objections to the proposed resumptions on 9&nbsp;August 1977, it intended (as it said) to proceed with an application for resumption. It should, I think, be also inferred that its application for the governor’s approval would have been successful, for there is no evidence of any basis for the refusal of such approval. This was the state of affairs when the plaintiffs gave notices of rescission. <em>There was then a probability verging upon certainty that if the purchase by the plaintiffs were to be completed the properties would be resumed</em> … The sale to the plaintiffs had had the effect of setting the market price for the properties, and that price would probably have been the basis for compensation on resumption. Thus if uncertainty as to the measure of compensation might have acted as a deterrent on resumption by council, that uncertainty was removed in substance by the price in the plaintiffs’ contracts.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"> <em>The question is whether this state of affairs amounted to a defect in the defendant’s title. I do not think it was. The defendant could transfer the title bargained for up until the resumption, and the plaintiffs could not refuse to complete in the state of affairs I have mentioned</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Once resumption was effected, however, the position would be essentially different, because of the inability to convey title.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judicial commissioner adopted the approach of Rath&nbsp;J and said, at [97]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The approach taken by Rath&nbsp;J in <em>Tsekos</em> shows that the essential analysis rests on the proposition raised by defence counsel, <em>viz</em> whether the s&nbsp;5 declaration has the effect of vesting ownership of the land in the State. Since I have already found that it does not, it follows that the plaintiff in this case was in a similar position to the vendor in <em>Tsekos</em>, <em>ie</em> a vendor owning a property that was certain to be acquired although it had not yet been acquired (within the meaning of s&nbsp;18 of the Act). …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note Rath&nbsp;J’s view that the state of affairs there existed did not amount to “a defect” in the vendor’s title. But it seems to us that what we have here is not truly “a defect” as such in the title to the property. Nor is it a question that the property is affected by any encumbrance or charge. It is a question of a change in the nature or duration of the title. The process of compulsory land acquisition which <em>de facto</em> had begun with the s&nbsp;5 declaration had changed the nature or duration of the title. The title had become no longer one as provided in the agreement – be it a fee simple or in perpetuity – but a defeasible one which within a short period of time would vest in the State, as it did. Hence, again, giving the matter a sense of reality, what the purchaser would have got had he completed the purchase, would not, in our opinion, be a good and marketable title; what he would have got would be a defeasible title and an unsaleable one. It clearly was not what he had bargained for.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the respondent in support of his argument that the s&nbsp;5 declaration did not operate as a blot or defect in the title relied on the decision of this court in <em>Huang Ching Hwee v Heng Kay Pah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1992] 3 SLR(R) 0452.xml&#39;)">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 452</a>. In that case, the vendor had prior to the conclusion of the contract carried out unauthorised alterations to the house (sold under the contract) without the approval of the building authority but no notice had been issued by such authority of any action to be taken in relation to such alterations. This court held that the potential liability in respect of such unauthorised alterations did not constitute a defect of title. Warren L&nbsp;H Khoo&nbsp;J delivering the judgment of the court said, at [51]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The mere fact that a state of affairs exist which might bring into operation the provisions of a law imposing a liability or burden is not enough to constitute a defect of title. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That <em>dictum</em> must be read in the context of the factual situation which prevailed in that case. In the later part of the judgment, Warren L&nbsp;H Khoo&nbsp;J said at [52], [53], [55] and [56]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our Building Control Act, although the building authority has power to take any of a number of actions prescribed by the Act in case of any infringement, it does not follow that it will necessarily do so. It might for any of a number of reasons decide not to take action in any particular case. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence in the instant case that the authorities had threatened to take action against the infringement. All that has been shown is that the approval for the works was not obtained, not that the works were of such a character that they actually contravened the requirements of any building regulations. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although the potential for enforcement action by the building authority was always there, there was never any certainty or inevitability about it.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would give rise to great uncertainty and unnecessary disputes in conveyancing practice if the mere potential of enforcement action by the authorities were to be treated as something going to title.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, there was only a potential liability with respect to the house, and it was speculative as to what action the building authority would take in relation thereto. The instant case is far from that. Whatever the position may be, we cannot say that “there was never any certainty or inevitability about it”. On the contrary, at the material time, the process of compulsory acquisition had begun and would lead inexorably (as it did) to divesting the owner of her title to the property and vesting it in the State.

We make the usual consequential order for the refund to the purchaser of the deposit in court as security for costs.</p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy">Headnoted by Arvin Lee.</p> </div></content></root></maincontent></maincontent><br> <br> </div> <p><a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1994]%201%20SLR(R)%200233.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#anomagicid" class="goTop floatRight">Back to top</a></p> <p class="pageContentCopyright"> </p><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Singapore Academy of Law.</p> <p></p> <!-- Content Details Body Ends --> </div><!-- Result Display Ends --> <div class="annotator-outer annotator-viewer annotator-hide">
