The motion arises from my judgment in MA&nbsp;159/1996 in which I allowed the respondent’s appeal and quashed his convictions for offences under s&nbsp;5 sub-ss&nbsp;(1) and (2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap&nbsp;213) (“OSA”). I do not propose to repeat the facts of the case, and my determination thereon, which are stated in my judgment in the Magistrate’s Appeal (see <em>Bridges Christopher v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent"

questions which the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> wishes this court to refer to the Court of Appeal are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a> <b>Question 1</b>: Whether, for the purpose of determining whether the offence of unauthorised communication of information has been committed under sub-s&nbsp;(i) of s&nbsp;5(1) of the Official Secrets Act, the word “information”, in the context in which it is enacted, refers to</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“secret official information”, or</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any information as described in paras&nbsp;(a) to (e) of that sub-section; and in the case of para&nbsp;(e), whether the said word means any information obtained by any person or to which he had access, owing to his position as a person who holds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who holds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government, or as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract.</p> <p class="Judg-2"> <b>Question 2</b>: If the answer to Question&nbsp;1 is (a), whether the information relating to the change of address of any person in Singapore is “secret official”:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_a_1"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the nature of the information or,</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_b_2"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the words “secret official” in section&nbsp;5(1) qualify the word “information”, or</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of some other factor.</p> <p class="Judg-2"> <b>Question 3</b>: If the answer to Question&nbsp;1 is (b), whether, in a case where the Prosecution has proved the commission of the offence of unauthorised communication under s&nbsp;5(1)(e)(i), [by Ganesan] the Prosecution has to discharge the burden of proving further that the information so communicated <em>has not been made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> from an authorised source</em> for the purpose of proving that the recipient thereof is a person to whom the communicator is not authorised to communicate that information under s&nbsp;5(2) of the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p class="Judg-2"> <b>Question 4</b>: If the answer to Question&nbsp;3 is “No”, whether a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made against an accused [Bridges] for the offence of unauthorised receipt of information under s&nbsp;5(2) of the Official Secrets Act where the Prosecution had proved that the accused had sought and obtained the information from a police officer [Ganesan] whom he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was a field intelligence officer performing the duties of gathering and evaluating intelligence on criminal activities and to have used facilities available to his Unit or to him as a member thereof, to obtain the information.</p> <p class="Judg-2"> <b>Question 5</b>: Whether, in the context of the Official Secrets Act, the act of communicating information for the purpose of the offence of unauthorised communication under s&nbsp;5(1) of the Official Secrets Act requires an intention on the part of the communicator to communicate the information, or merely any voluntary act which has resulted in the communication of the information to the recipient.</p> <p class="Judg-2"> <b>Question 6</b>: Whatever the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> may be in relation to Question&nbsp;5, whether the offence of unauthorised communication of information under para&nbsp;(i) of s&nbsp;5(1) of the Official Secrets Act requires <em>mens rea</em> in addition to the <em>actus reus</em> of communicating, in the form of:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2--p3_a_3"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“knowledge of the wrongfulness in committing the act complained of”

Before examining it, it is useful to set out the relevant parts of that section again:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter had been determined by the High Court, the judge may, on the application of any party and shall on the application of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as was submitted by Mr&nbsp;Khoo for the respondent, and not disputed by Mr&nbsp;Reddy, the starting position is the general principle that the High Court is the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the Subordinate Courts. Generally, there is thus no need for the Court of Appeal to conduct a further review. This was stated by me in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1995] 1 SLR(R) 0388.xml&#39;)">[1995] 1 SLR(R) 388</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same point was made by Chan Sek Keong&nbsp;J (as he then was) in <em>Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1990] 1 SLR(R) 0198.xml&#39;)">[1990] 1 SLR(R) 198</a>; I cannot put it any better than he did, so I content myself with repeating what he said (at [29]–[30]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is on these considerations that the courts in Malaysia and Singapore have recognised the limitations of s&nbsp;60.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts. Hence, Suffian ACJ’s caution that the provision be used sparingly lest it be made use of as an appeal provision.</p> <p class="Judg-1">It remains only to be added that this passage was approved by the Court of <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal which answered the questions stated. That decision was reported in <em>Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1991] 2 SLR(R) 0344.xml&#39;)">[1991] 2 SLR(R) 344</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is recognised that there are certain cases in which a further reference of questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> to the Court of Appeal may be deemed necessary to settle any conflicting issues. Such questions must be exceptional. Section&nbsp;60 itself sets out the relevant parameters. Hence, the question must be a “question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the question must be a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. A mere question of fact is not within the scope of s&nbsp;60, and it is improper for the High Court to refer such a question to the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> must be one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. Not every question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> suffices. This was succinctly stated by Raja Azlan Shah Ag L&nbsp;P in the Malaysian Federal Court decision of <em>A Ragunathan v PR</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/38663-M.xml&#39;)">[1982] 1&nbsp;MLJ 139</a> at 141:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">But it is not sufficient that the question raised is a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. It must be a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. What is <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest must surely depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> raised in the course of the appeal is of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this court or by the Privy Council or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternate views. If the question is settled by the highest court or the general principles in determining the question are well settled and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case, the question would not be a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage was approved by the Court of <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal in <em>Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1997]%201%20SLR(R)%200681.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_5">[5]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). In that case, I also opined in the Court of <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal that the questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> should be questions which, by their nature, would affect the outcome of cases other than those from which they arose. There is also the passage from Chan Sek Keong&nbsp;J’s judgment which I have cited earlier.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr&nbsp;Reddy also referred me to <em>PP v Lim Joo Soon</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/38315-M.xml&#39;)">[1981] 1&nbsp;MLJ 107</a>. In that case, the Federal Court in Malaysia held:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are of the view that the word ‘shall’ in the said s&nbsp;66(1) in respect of any application by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, should be given effect to, and that the position here is the same as it is under the English <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal Act 1907. The <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>’s application coming as it is from such an august officer of the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> removes from the discretion of the court the right to decide on whether the question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> is of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. When the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> applies for reference, on the clear purport of the said s&nbsp;66(1), it must be taken that any question posed by him is of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest, unless of course it can be shown that the question is indeed of his own personal interest and no one else.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That case appears to hold that any question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> posed by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> is presumed to be of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest unless it can be shown that it is only of his own personal interest. With the utmost deference and respect to the Federal Court in that case, it appears that the court may have been confused by the arguments over the exercise of discretion with the preconditions to s&nbsp;66 of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964. A plain reading of s&nbsp;60 (which for relevant purposes is <em>in pari materia</em> to s&nbsp;66 of the Malaysian Act), leads to the conclusion that the question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> must be of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest before any question of discretion arises. It is only when the question falls within the four corners of s&nbsp;60 that the court has a discretion to reserve it to the Court of Appeal when the application is made by someone other than the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>. Similarly, it is only then that the court has no discretion but must refer the question when it is stated by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> rarely, if ever, has any personal interest in a criminal prosecution. Whenever he, or a deputy <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">prosecutor</span>, brings a prosecution, it is done in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. Likewise, whenever an appeal is brought by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, it is brought because he or a deputy <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">prosecutor</span> believes that it is in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that it should be brought. Similarly, when the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> makes an application for questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> to be referred to the Court of Appeal, he must believe that it is in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that they should be referred. However, it does not necessarily follow that the questions stated are therefore questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my respectful judgment, where the Federal Court erred is that it failed to distinguish different types of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. As was pointed out by the Minister for <span class="blueHighlight">Law</span> during the Second Reading in the Parliamentary Debates on 12&nbsp;April&nbsp;1993 on the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment Bill), there is more than one type of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. There is the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that justice is done in each individual case, and there is the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that principles of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> are correctly and authoritatively decided for future cases. In neither case does the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> have only a personal interest, and it is only the latter that s&nbsp;60 is concerned with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would repeat what I said in the Court of <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal in <em>Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1997]%201%20SLR(R)%200681.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_5">[5]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at [11]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear from the terms of s&nbsp;60 that the court has discretion whether or not to refer a question to the Court of <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Appeal when the application to the court is made by a party other than the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, even if the question satisfies all the prescribed conditions. It is equally clear that the reference must be of a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest, which has arisen in the course of the appeal, and the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal. The crucial condition in the present case was whether these were questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application may have been made to state a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> because it is thought that it is in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that a principle of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> arising from the case be correctly and authoritatively decided. On the other hand, an application may have been made because it is thought that it is in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that justice is done in the individual case and that a disguised appeal should be launched. Unless there is an express provision otherwise in s&nbsp;60 of the SCJA, the court should not abdicate the duty of sieving the former from the latter to the office of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>. Had it been the Legislature’s intention that any question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, no matter how trivial or settled, is presumed or deemed to be a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest merely because it is stated by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, there would be nothing simpler than for it to state this expressly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> is of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest or not depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, not the exercise of discretion. It is for the court to decide. The contrary position comes dangerously close to meaning that the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> has a right of further appeal to the Court of Appeal on questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, but the accused does not. I have great confidence in the august office of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, but I must respectfully say that the duty of being the final arbiter of whether a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> is one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest falls on this court, not on the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>’s office.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the third precondition, the question must have arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by this court must have affected the event of the appeal. There is no difficulty with what this requirement means, and reference need only be made to <em>PP v Choo Ching Hwa</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/41499-M.xml&#39;)">[1990] 3&nbsp;MLJ 229</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains the last principle, which, as I have stated, is that the court retains a discretion whether or not to refer a question to the Court of Appeal when the application is made by a party other than the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, even if the question satisfies all the prescribed conditions. However, where such an application, satisfying all the conditions, is made by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, the court has no discretion but must reserve them for the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the principle that the conditions prescribed by s&nbsp;60 for the reservation of questions to the Court of Appeal must be satisfied, whether the questions are stated by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> or some other party, and also the principle that there is no discretion if a question satisfying all the conditions are stated by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, I twice ascertained from Mr&nbsp;Reddy whether the court has the discretion to reframe questions drawn up, even by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, to ensure that they fit within the ambit of s&nbsp;60. I was fortified by Mr&nbsp;Reddy’s reply in both instances that the court must have such a discretion. Nevertheless, I do not think that such a discretion extends beyond ensuring that the questions posed fall within the four corners of s&nbsp;60 or restating the questions so that they are made clearer. In doing so, the court should always bear in mind the substance of the questions stated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the questions which the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> wishes this court to reserve for the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question 1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very wide question. It is no doubt a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> and is of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest, for it effectively determines the scope of s&nbsp;5 of the OSA and would have far reaching consequences amongst, firstly government servants, and secondly, members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> who deal with them. However, framed in this manner, I have some reservation whether the question is one which had arisen in the course of the appeal, the determination of which by me had affected the event of the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the appeal, I decided that addresses can be information falling within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA. The issue was effectively determined in favour of the Prosecution, regardless of my interpretation of the word “information” in s&nbsp;5. What I had to decide there was whether it had been shown to be protected by s&nbsp;5. It was never part of the Prosecution’s case in the District Court or before me that any information as described in s&nbsp;5 is caught by that provision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial before the District Court took a very different course. The Prosecution there called or adduced evidence from such a diverse selection of government departments as the Land Transport Authority and the Registry of Companies and Businesses to show that the information could not have come from these departments. There was also an agreement with the Defence that this information was not released by the Housing and Development Board and the Central Provident Fund Board. This would have been superfluous, and possibly misleading, if it had been the Prosecution’s case that any information suffices.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the substance of the case before me in the appeal was as follows, and I quote from Mr&nbsp;Reddy’s submission to me in the appeal, at paras&nbsp;34, 35 and 36:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is submitted that the mere fact that such information may be available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> from some government bodies does not detract from its nature as protected official information because in those instances, the release of the information by these government bodies would amount to the authorised release of protected information but it is not carte blanche authorisation for the release of such information. If this information is obtained from an unauthorised source or in an unauthorised manner, it would amount to an unauthorised disclosure within the meaning of OSA as an unauthorised disclosure of information does not bring it into the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> domain and those who handle it may be liable to prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official information retains its character as such and remains protected by s&nbsp;5 until it is published or released to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by the Government or a Government officer with authority to publish or release it …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the measures taken to secure this information contained in the NRO database and the restricted access to such information, it is clear that the information on the NRO records is information protected by the OSA and this information could only be released through authorised channels with proper authorisation for authorised purposes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument in the District Court was much the same. I quote from Ms&nbsp;Jasbendar Kaur’s submission for the Prosecution at the close of the Defence’s case:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence may well argue that information pertaining to the latest addresses of individuals is not protected information as this information is accessible to members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> through the <em>Electoral Register and various governmental agencies</em>, private investigation agencies, credit card companies etc.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is submitted that the mere fact that such information may be available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> <em>from government bodies</em> does not detract from its nature as protected official information because in those instances, the release of the information by these government bodies would amount to the authorised release of protected information but is not carte blanche authorisation for the release of such information in any other circumstances. If this information is obtained from an unauthorised source or in an authorised manner, it would amount to an unauthorised disclosure within the meaning of OSA. As such, the crucial consideration must be the manner in which such information is obtained.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not accept this argument in the appeal for the reasons stated in my judgment, even though I agreed with the argument that an unauthorised disclosure of protected information does not bring it within the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> domain. On the contrary, I understood it to be a concession by the Prosecution that information that had been released to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so thereby falls outside s&nbsp;5. This would, by itself, qualify the word “information” in s&nbsp;5 so that it cannot be any information as described in s&nbsp;5.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing me on the motion, however, Mr&nbsp;Reddy strenuously denied that this was a concession. As I understood the Prosecution’s position, it seemed to me to amount to saying this: never mind that information is protected by s&nbsp;5 until it is published or released to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so, nevertheless it remains protected by s&nbsp;5 even after it has been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so as long as some government department chooses to ignore the fact that it had already been published, released or made available by some other authorised person; after all any information is caught by s&nbsp;5. As I held in the appeal, this was “an inherently inconsistent position to adopt”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said in my judgment that the issue of whether information falls within s&nbsp;5 is different from the issue of authorisation, implied or otherwise, for the release of that information. This is axiomatic. Information must first be protected before any question of authorisation to release it arises. One does not need authorisation to release unprotected information.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, it is a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, and it is one of great <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> importance, for it would affect every member of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> who ever has any occasion to deal with any government servant or department. If what the Prosecution contended is correct, members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> would no doubt be surprised to learn that information that has already been published in the Gazette or information readily available from government departments, such as the lot and mukim numbers of a piece of property, or the name of the Chief Justice for that matter, is nevertheless information protected by s&nbsp;5 of the OSA, and that they pass on such information at their peril. If ordinary citizens can be fined or even sent to prison for receiving or communicating information that has been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by government departments, they had better be told this, and soon.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it affects every <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> servant if the Prosecution’s argument is correct. If a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> servant learns in the course of his employment who the Minister heading his ministry is, that is protected information. If he learns that there is a Subordinate Courts building at Paterson Road, that is protected information. If a Deputy <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> learns in the course of preparing for a prosecution that the OSA is Cap&nbsp;213, and that s&nbsp;5 creates offences, that is protected information. If a national serviceman learns in the course of his Basic Military Training that a major outranks a captain in the Singapore Armed Forces, that is protected information. If he learns that the M-16 is a rifle but the F-16 is an aeroplane, that is protected information. And if he learns that, contrary to what he had thought, his own height is 1.72m and not 1.71m, or that his blood type is “O+”, that too is protected information because it is in his personnel file, which must at least be confidential. As the Prosecution contends, everything is protected information. The ramifications are unfathomable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, in case I had misapprehended the thrust of the Prosecution’s argument in the appeal, I will state Question&nbsp;1. It is in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest that the issue is authoritatively settled by the highest court in Singapore. However, I must modify it to relate it to the issues raised at the appeal. This I have done by, amongst other things, deleting the second part of the question. This is because the answer to that part would necessarily follow from the answer to the first part, and, in that context, it is not a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. In its place, I have added a new part (b). The question I will state is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the word “information” in s&nbsp;5(1) of the OSA, in the context in which it is enacted, refers to</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_31-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“secret official … information” as described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of that subsection, or</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_31-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any information as described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of that subsection.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, does information that has been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so nevertheless remain information falling within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question&nbsp;2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is merely an adjunct to Question&nbsp;1 as framed by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>. It is, however, an academic question. I do not see how the determination of this affected the outcome of the appeal. Nevertheless, it seems to me that what the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> is trying to do is to seek the determination of the Court of Appeal on the general question of what criteria determine whether information falls within s&nbsp;5 or outside it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Question&nbsp;1 as framed by me, this is still a legitimate question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. It is likewise of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> importance, for members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> must be able to discern what is or is not information falling within s&nbsp;5. It would also have affected the event of the appeal. I will therefore reframe Question&nbsp;2 as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>If the answer to Question 1(a) is “any information” or the answer to Question 1(b) is “yes”, when will information cease to fall within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question&nbsp;3</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, I must admit that I have had difficulty in understanding Question&nbsp;3. The question of whether the burden falls on the Prosecution to prove that the information communicated has not been made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> from an authorised source is relevant to the question of whether the Prosecution has proven that the information falls within s&nbsp;5. If that question has yet to be decided, I am at a loss as to how the Prosecution can be said to have proven an offence under s&nbsp;5(1)(<em>e</em>)(i), or any other part of s&nbsp;5 of the OSA, so far as this case was concerned. It was the very same thing that had to be decided in the trial, both in relation to Ganesan and the respondent, before there could be a finding that either of them had committed any offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it seems that what the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> wants is a determination of the question on whom the burden lay of proving that information falls within s&nbsp;5. Normally, such a question, albeit a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, would not be one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. It is trite <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> that the burden of proving each and every element of an offence falls on the Prosecution. I should also add that the Prosecution had very properly conceded that the burden lay upon it to prove each and every element of the offence. Reference may be made to para 1 of Miss&nbsp;Jasbendar Kaur’s submission in the District Court at the close of the Defence’s case. This must necessarily include the burden of proving that the information falls within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the fact that the determination of this question would have a profound impact on each and every citizen in Singapore who ever has to obtain information from a government servant or department, I am of the view that the question can be said to be one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. It hardly needs to be said that the ordinary citizen is often not in a position to discharge the burden, for this is something that is usually wholly within the knowledge of the government. If the burden is on him, then it may, in practical effect, render the answers to Questions&nbsp;1 and 2 academic. In relation to such a potentially wide provision as the OSA, it is a question of great <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question arose from the appeal, the determination of which by me had affected the outcome of the appeal. I effectively held that the burden fell on the Prosecution and it had failed to discharge it because it had failed to call the Registration Officer and therefore there was no evidence whether the Registration Officer had published, released or made available the addresses to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>. For this reason, I will rephrase the question to make it clearer:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>In a prosecution for an offence under s&nbsp;5 of the OSA, notwithstanding that the burden lay on the prosecution to prove that the information falls within s&nbsp;5, whether the prosecution has to prove that the information has not been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question&nbsp;4</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Question&nbsp;1 was too wide, Question&nbsp;4 appears to me with respect to be too narrow. As framed, it is specific to the facts of this case and can hardly be said to be of any <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. Still, it is not difficult to fathom that what the Prosecution was getting at is the question of whether it is sufficient for the Prosecution to prove that the accused knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the person he obtained it from is a government servant who obtained it in the course of his employment as such. And on a more specific, though no less important, level, the question arose in relation to information of a class which is commonly published, released or made available by the government. I will therefore rephrase Question&nbsp;4 to make it wider:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, in the case of a prosecution under s&nbsp;5(2), a <em>prima facie</em> case of <em>mens rea</em> is made out by merely proving that the recipient knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect that that piece of information came from a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> servant who obtained it in the course of his work, although it has not been proven that the recipient knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that that particular piece of information falls within s&nbsp;5.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “yes”, whether it makes any difference that the information belongs to a class which is ordinarily released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question&nbsp;5</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting question. Unfortunately it did not arise at all in the appeal because it was established beyond all doubt that the respondent had intended to communicate the said information to the recipient, PW1. I will not refer it to the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question&nbsp;6 </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of this question deals with whether s&nbsp;5(1) creates a strict liability offence. It is no doubt a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. However, I agree with Mr&nbsp;Khoo that it is not one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. I have already stated the applicable principles in relation to whether a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> is one of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. The principles applicable in determining whether an offence is one of strict liability have long been authoritatively laid down by the Privy Council in an appeal from this jurisdiction in <em>Lim Chin Aik v The Queen</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/64337-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1963] AC&nbsp;160</a>; <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/34317-M.xml&#39;)">[1963] MLJ&nbsp;50</a>. These principles have been consistently applied by the courts in Singapore. The question simply involves the application of well-established principles to s&nbsp;5(1) of the OSA. The very same question was determined by L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J in <em>PP v Phua Keng Tong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1985-1986] SLR(R) 0545.xml&#39;)">[1985–1986] SLR(R) 545</a>, which I agreed with and followed in the appeal. There is therefore no conflict of judicial authority. This point has been settled for over a decade.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, there is no conflict of authority in relation to the second part of this question. Although Mr&nbsp;Reddy submitted that L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J had held that <em>mens rea</em> is constituted by “knowledge of the wrongfulness in committing the act complained of” in <em>PP v Phua Keng Tong</em>, it seems evident to me that L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J had been quoted out of context. In that case, L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J considered the following (at [21]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The question really is whether Tan communicated P9 and attempted to communicate P11 and P12 to Phua in the knowledge that it was wrong to do so. That of course must turn on the evidence before the learned judge, which, so far as material, is this. Tan had been in the Government service since 1966 and at the material time was occupying a senior position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; he was a superscale officer. He had signed undertakings to safeguard official information on no less than three occasions; the last occasion was as recent as 4&nbsp;December 1980. Tan knew that he received the documents in question in his official position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; he knew to whom these documents were authorised to be sent and he knew that Phua was not one of such persons. He deliberately caused copies of these documents to be made and he deliberately sent the copies to Phua, though he did it openly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Tan in that case knew that it was wrong to communicate the documents to Phua because he knew that it was information protected by the OSA and he knew that he did not have the authority to communicate it to Phua. Mr&nbsp;Reddy’s contention that there was a conflict of authority was even more remarkable considering that Ms&nbsp;Jasbendar Kaur had in her closing submission in the District Court acknowledged that what I have said was in fact what L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J meant. At para 25 of her closing submission, she had argued:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… However, even if this court is of the view that it is bound by the decision in <em>Phua’s</em> case that <em>mens rea</em> is required, it is submitted that the <em>Phua’s</em> test of <em>mens rea</em> is satisfied in this case as the first accused knew that he was not authorised to communicate the information to the second accused but nevertheless proceeded to communicate that information. This appears to be the <em>mens rea</em>’s test applied by the learned senior district judge in <em>PP v Manu s/o Bhaskaran</em> DAC 14077– 14079/92 (unreported) at p&nbsp;73.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much the same thing was repeated by Ms&nbsp;Jasbendar Kaur at paras&nbsp;12 and 13 in her submission at the end of the Defence’s case. The passage must necessarily presuppose knowledge that the information is protected information in the first place, before any question of authorisation arises. I have no doubt that L&nbsp;P Thean&nbsp;J merely used the words “knowledge of wrongfulness” as a shorthand to describe the elements of <em>mens rea</em> which I had held must be proven by the Prosecution. He was not referring to some woolly concept of “wrongfulness”. There is no conflict of judicial authority. This issue likewise has been settled for over a decade, and the test has been consistently applied.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of determining the mental elements in relation to an offence under s&nbsp;5(1), this is a simple exercise of looking at the wording of that section and relating the mental elements to the <em>actus reus</em> required by it. It is hardly conceptually difficult. It is a mere application of existing principles. While it is a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, it is not of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest. I do not think that it falls within the scope of s&nbsp;60 of the SCJA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I must express my disinclination to reserve this question for the Court of Appeal. However, since it has not been authoritatively decided by the Court of Appeal whether the requirement that a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> must be of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest is a precondition to the exercise of the court’s power under s&nbsp;60 before any question of discretion arises, I will state the question. In doing so, I have in mind the consideration that it is always open to the Court of Appeal to decline to answer the question if it is of the view that it should not have been stated. On the other hand, a refusal by this court to state a question is not appealable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to some revisions to the question to make it clearer, I will reluctantly state the following question:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether an offence under s&nbsp;5(1) of the OSA is one of strict liability.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “no”, what are the requisite elements of <em>mens rea</em> for an offence under s&nbsp;5(1)?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Questions&nbsp;7 and 8</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted that these two questions relate to the issue of <em>stare decisis</em> in an appeal from a subordinate court, <em>ie</em> in a summary trial. It is quite clear from [86] of my judgment (<em>Bridges Christopher v PP</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1997]%201%20SLR(R)%200681.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_1">[1]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>)) that I had distinguished <em>Osman bin Ali v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1971-1973] SLR(R) 0503.xml&#39;)">[1971–1973] SLR(R) 503</a>.

In these circumstances, issues of <em>stare decisis</em> did not arise in the appeal, and even if they did, they did not affect the event of the appeal.

They do not fall within s&nbsp;60.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is no dispute that there remains the question whether and in what circumstances the Prosecution can be permitted to call rebuttal evidence in relation to an issue which had not arisen <em>ex improviso</em>, which had not taken the Prosecution by surprise, and upon which the burden of proof lay on the Prosecution. This is a question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. It is no doubt a question of procedure.

It was of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest because it affected all summary trials and was an important question pertaining to the administration of justice. The same is true of the question here. It relates to the fundamental question of whether the Prosecution must prove its case before it closes it, or whether it can make up for any shortcoming as it goes along, as and when it pleases, so that the well-worn phrase “the Prosecution closes its case” becomes quite meaningless. I will reserve a narrower question even though it did not appear on the face of Questions&nbsp;7 and 8:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Prosecution should be allowed in a summary criminal trial to call rebuttal evidence in relation to an issue upon which the burden of proof is on the Prosecution, which has not taken the Prosecution by surprise nor arisen unexpectedly in the trial, and which the Prosecution could or ought reasonably to have foreseen.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “yes”, under what circumstances should the trial court allow the Prosecution to do so?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I will reserve the following questions arising from the appeal for the determination of the Court of Appeal:</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;1: (a) Whether the word “information” in s&nbsp;5(1) of the OSA, in the context in which it is enacted, refers to</p> <p></p><div class="Judg-List-1-No"></div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">(i) “secret official … information” as described in paras&nbsp;(a) to (e) of that subsection, or</div><p></p> <p></p><div class="Judg-List-1-No"></div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">(ii) any information as described in paras&nbsp;(a) to (e) of that sub-section.</div><p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, does information that has been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so nevertheless remain information falling within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA?</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;2: If the answer to Question&nbsp;1(a) is “any information” or the answer to Question&nbsp;1(b) is “yes”, when will information cease to fall within s&nbsp;5 of the OSA?</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;3: In a prosecution for an offence under s&nbsp;5 of the OSA, notwithstanding that the burden lay on the Prosecution to prove that the information falls within s&nbsp;5, whether the Prosecution has to prove that the information has not been published, released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> by a person authorised to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;4: (a) Whether, in the case of a prosecution under s&nbsp;5(2), a <em>prima facie</em> case of <em>mens rea</em> is made out by merely proving that the recipient knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect that that piece of information came from a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> servant who obtained it in the course of his work, although it has not been proven that the recipient knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that that particular piece of information falls within s&nbsp;5.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_b_6"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “yes”, whether it makes any difference that the information belongs to a class which is ordinarily released or made available to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;5: (a) Whether an offence under s&nbsp;5(1) of the OSA is one of strict liability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_b_7"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “no”, what are the requisite elements of <em>mens rea</em> for an offence under s&nbsp;5(1)?</p> <p class="Judg-1">Question&nbsp;6: (a) Whether the Prosecution should be allowed in a summary criminal trial to call rebuttal evidence in relation to an issue upon which the burden of proof is on the Prosecution, which has not taken the Prosecution by surprise nor arisen unexpectedly in the trial, and which the Prosecution could or ought reasonably to have foreseen.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_b_8"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to (a) is “yes”, under what circumstances should the trial court allow the Prosecution to do so?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add a postscript by saying that, in reserving these questions to the Court of Appeal, I have carried out extensive surgery on the questions framed by the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, in order to bring them in my view within s&nbsp;60 of the SCJA, as well as to make some of them clearer.
