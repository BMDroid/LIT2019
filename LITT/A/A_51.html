Moreover, as OHIM rightly contends, and despite the elements referred to by the applicant—such as the reproduction of the “S” device element on the cover of Seat's annual report or on the front of the cars sold by that company—<b>that device element has no intrinsic semantic content of its own which would lend the earlier trade mark distinctive character, but primarily has the purpose of accentuating the first letter of the word “seat”</b>.

Furthermore, the Elongated P device is integrated into the Pirelli Mark and does not appear to be a separate element within the whole mark that is indicative of a business origin. Taking guidance from <i>Honda</i>, I find that the Elongated P does not appear very original or elaborate in that it is likely to be perceived by the average English-speaking Singaporean consumer as a letter "P" that has the primary purpose of accentuating the first letter of the word "Pirelli".</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I find that the textual components of the competing marks are the dominant component of the Pirelli Mark and the Application Mark.&nbsp; In <i>Hai Tong</i>, the Court of Appeal held at [62(d)] that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The textual component of a composite mark or sign could (but will not necessarily or always) be the dominant component of the mark or sign.

However, the overall resemblance between them is diminished by the fact that both marks comprise of words that are completely different from each other.&nbsp; The Pirelli Mark is comprised of the word "Pirelli" whilst the Application Mark is comprised of the word(s) "Ts.Project".&nbsp; Whilst "Ts" does not have any meaning, the word "Project" could be synonymous with a scheme, plan, task or assignment.&nbsp; Based on the extract from the New Oxford Dictionary of English tendered by the Applicant (Exhibit 6), the word "project" refers to "an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim."&nbsp; The word "Pirelli", on the other hand, is an invented word that does not have any meaning in the English language.&nbsp; Given that the dominance of the textual component of the competing marks, I find that visually, the Pirelli Mark and the Application Mark are not similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Aural Similarity</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where aural similarity is concerned, the court in <i>Ozone Community Corp v Advance Magazine Publishers Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 0459.xml&#39;)">[2010] 2 SLR 459</a></nobr> <i>("Ozone")</i> at p 491-2 affirmed the statement in <i>Bently &amp; Sherman</i> (3<sup>rd</sup>ed, 2009) that when comparing marks aurally, tribunals tend to carry out a quantitative assessment as to whether the two signs have more syllables in common than not.&nbsp; This was affirmed by the Court of Appealin <i>Hai Tong</i> at [68]. &nbsp; In the present case, the Pirelli Mark is likely to be pronounced in 3 syllables, viz, "PEE-REH-LEE" whereas the Application Mark is likely to be pronounced as "TEE-ESS-PRO-JECT" (4 syllables) or "TEE-ESS-DOT-PRO-JECT" (5 syllables), due to the presence of the full stop.

The word(s) "Ts.Project" in the Application Mark gives the impression that "Ts" is separate from "Project" given the full stop between the two words. "Ts Project" in and of itself is a meaningless combination of words. To the average Singaporean consumer, the term "Project" could be synonymous with a scheme, plan, task or assignment. However, the term "Ts" does not have any meaning and does not clarify the scope of the word "Project".&nbsp; In <i>Sarika</i>, the Court of Appeal referred to the case of <i>Hyundai Mobis v Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/55337-M.xml&#39;)">[2007] SGIPOS 12</a></nobr> ("<i>Mobil</i>") and held at [34] that</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">[The Principal Assistant Registrar in <i>Mobil</i>] concluded that no finding of conceptual similarity could be made because the "Mobil" and the "Mobis" marks were meaningless.

There is no evidence of the use of these trade marks in Singapore. As for (iv), this is a website printout that only describe types of car tyres that are called "P7", "P6", "Cinturato P7", "P Zero Rosso", "P Zero System", "P Zero", "P Zero Corsa System" – none of which make any reference to the Opponents Marks. Item (v) is a snapshot of the company's history from its founding in 1872 to date, describing the evolution of its business from a factory producing rubber articles, to insulated wire for telegraphy, bicycle tyres, car tyres, eventually going into real estate and telecoms.

However, it is not clear which market(s) this is for and whether the estimate was made after the relevant date. There is no other information about the Opponents' brand value in Singapore <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; In any event, the disclaimer on the last page of the presentation slides states that "[this] presentation contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements based on Pirelli &amp; C SpA's current expectations and projections about future events" and that "[s]uch forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements, many of which are beyond the ability of Pirelli &amp; C SpA to control or estimate precisely.

The Opponents' Marks are "predominantly used on the Opponents' range of tyre products for use on vehicles including cars, SUVs, and vans," (Opponents' SD at [8]) and their trade mark registrations are for products including belt conveyors, data processing equipment, cables, pneumatic tyres, driving belts, boats, athletic bags and other related accessories thereto. The Applicant's business, on the other hand, is in the design and supply of "curtains, blinds, sunshades and the parts thereof" (see Applicant's SD at [4]) and they have sought registration in Classes 20 and 24, for bamboo and rattan related products (including window blinds, curtains and related accessories thereto), as well as woven and knitted fabrics for curtains, curtain accessories, furnishing and upholstery.&nbsp; There does not appear to be any relation between the Opponents' and the Applicant's scope or intended scope of business.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Ground of Opposition under Section 7(6)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(6) of the Act reads:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><b><span lang="EN-GB">7.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">— (6)&nbsp;A trade mark shall not be registered&nbsp;if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Opponents' Submissions</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents submit that, on the basis of a "tripartite test" found in <i>Shell and Co (Aust) Ltd v Rohm and Haas</i> <nobr>[1949] 78 CLR 601</nobr>, followed by the local case of <i>Tiffany &amp; Co v Fabriques de Tabac Reunies SA</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/8754-M.xml&#39;)">[1999] 3 SLR 147</a></nobr>, that they have ownership of the Opponents' Marks.&nbsp; Following this, the Opponents submit that the Applicant should have adduced evidence proving her claim to the ownership and right to register the Application Mark which features the Elongated P in Singapore.

In <i>Rothmans</i>, the competing marks were not similar, but the parties had been embroiled in several long-standing disputes overseas. The High Court found that the trade mark application was made in bad faith because of several suspicious circumstances: the manner in which the applicant<span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid">s</span> obtained <s>its</s><u>their</u> company registration, their advertising strategy that drew emphasis on the resemblance between their product and that of the opponents, and the fact that the trade mark applied for was a mere variation of another mark that the applicants were prohibited from registering under an Europe-wide injunction (see, generally, at [36] – [42] of <i>Rothmans</i>).&nbsp; This factual scenario is far removed from the present case, where no evidence or submissions have been put forward as to the Applicants' alleged bad faith.<a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the foregoing, the Opponents have failed to meetthe required standard of proof required in bad faith.
