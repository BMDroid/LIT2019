The vehicle was owned by a company of which the appellant was a director. Engaged by the Housing and Development Board to, among other things, clear and level the site, the company was permitted by the Land Office to maintain the site. When apprehended, the environment officers saw a heap of refuse amounting to some 17m<sup>3</sup> behind it. A notice to attend court was issued to the appellant and the vehicle was seized.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">The district judge had to consider whether the site in question was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. He held that although a gate and limited but damaged fencing around the site had been constructed, they were not constructed with the intention of restricting people from entering it. Accordingly, he found that the site was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. He held that instead of maintaining the site, the appellant had dumped refuse on it and he therefore convicted the appellant on a charge of illegal dumping. The appellant appealed. The issues were: (a)&nbsp;whether the site was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place; (b)&nbsp;whether the ingredients of dumping had been made out; and (c)&nbsp;whether the court could order the forfeiture of a vehicle used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.</p> <p class="HN-Heading">Held, allowing the appeal in part:</p> <p class="HN-Held">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the site was being maintained by the company was irrelevant to the question of whether it was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. While the meaning of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” was not always clear, it was pretty well settled that the question revolved around whether the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> had access to the place, whether in fact or in right.

The appellant was fined $800 and the lorry YH&nbsp;9235&nbsp;S (“the vehicle”), which was used in the dumping, was ordered to be forfeited under s&nbsp;20(4) of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant is a director of Sung Teong Constructions Pte Ltd (“the company”). The company is the owner of the vehicle. On 6&nbsp;July 1993, the company was engaged by the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) to demolish pig farms, fill up ponds and level the sites on four parcels of land. One of the parcels was at Lorong Buangkok (“the site”). On 3&nbsp;February 1994, the Land Office agreed to allow the company to maintain the site for 12&nbsp;months. The company then entered into a contract with the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> Works Department to demolish Queenstown Secondary Technical School between 23&nbsp;May and 31&nbsp;May 1994.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31&nbsp;May 1994, two environment health officers, Koh Chee Meng (“Koh”) and Lim Chui San (“Lim”), were in the vicinity of Buangkok South Farmway&nbsp;2. They were mounting a watch against illegal dumping of refuse. They saw the vehicle driven by the appellant in a tipping position. Upon rushing to the vehicle, the officers saw a heap of refuse amounting to some 17m<sup>3</sup> behind it. A notice to attend court was issued to the appellant and the vehicle was seized.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant parts of s&nbsp;20 state:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who drops, scatters, spills or throws any dirt, sand, earth, gravel, clay, loam, manure, refuse, sawdust, shavings, stone, straw or any other matter or thing in any <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place, whether from a moving or stationary vehicle or in any other manner shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where any vehicle is used in disposing or dumping of refuse, waste or any other article in any <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place, other than a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> disposal facility … the vehicle may be seized … and removed to and detained in any police station or Government depot or other place as approved by the Commissioner at the risk of the owner for the purposes of proceedings under this Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A court on convicting any person of an offence under subsection&nbsp;(1) shall, on the written application of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection&nbsp;(4) may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection&nbsp;(1) has been or will be held.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there be no prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1), the vehicle seized under that subsection shall be forfeited at the expiry of 3&nbsp;months from the date of the seizure unless a claim thereto is made before that date. Any person asserting that he is the owner of such vehicle may personally, or by his agent authorised in writing, give written notice to the Commissioner that he claims the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of a notice under subsection&nbsp;(6), the Commissioner may direct that the vehicle be released or may refer the matter by information to a Magistrate.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magistrate shall, on receipt of an information under subsection&nbsp;(7), or on the written application of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>, hold an inquiry and proceed to determine the matter and shall, on proof that the vehicle was used in the commission of an offence under subsection&nbsp;(1), order the vehicle to be forfeited, or may in the absence of such proof order its release.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus of great importance whether the site in question was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. If the site was not a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place, then an essential element of the offence is not made out and the appellant is entitled to be acquitted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the district judge, the evidence was that there was a limited length of damaged fence around parts of the site. One side of the site was not fenced at all, but it was not clear whether a drain ran alongside it. There was a gate on the road leading to the site. Koh testified that one can go through the gaps in the damaged fencing quite easily and that he in fact walked through such a gap beside the gate. Lim gained access to the site by going through a hole in the gate. The gate was locked.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant admitted in court that the photographs tendered by the Prosecution, which were taken some three months later, nevertheless reflected the state of the site on 31&nbsp;May 1994. He also admitted that many parts of the site were not fenced up.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence witness Ong Teow Peng (“Ong”), a land officer from the Land Office, testified that no physical barrier was built on the site. This was because when the site was taken over by the Land Office, there was a gate and parts of the perimeter were fenced up. However, he confirmed that parts of it were not fenced up. Ong also said that if members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> were to walk on the site, they would not be stopped or prosecuted. The reason was that the Land Office cannot stop people from walking on state land. However, the Land Office will not allow encroachment on state land. Cryptically, he stated that members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> do not have free access to the site.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of authorities were cited before the district judge. In the end, the district judge held that on the evidence before him, he was satisfied that the gate and the limited but damaged fencing around the site were not constructed with the intention of restricting people from entering upon the site. They were in fact remnants of what was left of the pig farm which had been demolished. The district judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that he locked the gate to prevent the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> from going onto the site. This was because the appellant had admitted in cross-examination that he locked the gate to prevent other vehicles from dumping refuse on the site. There was also a hole in the gate through which any person could enter. Accordingly, the district judge found that the site was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district judge then held that instead of maintaining the site, the appellant had dumped refuse on it. He therefore convicted the appellant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue argued before me was whether the site was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant. In order to do justice to counsel’s submission, it is necessary to go through the more relevant ones. However, the starting point is s&nbsp;2 of the Act. This states that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’ includes any place whether privately owned or not to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the authorities concern offences against <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> morality or <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> peace. <em>R v Kane</em> [1965] 1&nbsp;All ER 705 was a case dealing with affray in a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. This was a Crown Court case. The incident occurred in the Stage and Press Club at Leamington Spa. There was no doubt that this was private property. The question before the court was whether it could nevertheless be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. Barry&nbsp;J in his direction to the jury said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here is no substantial difference between the meaning of ‘a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’ as defined by the statute and the meaning of ‘a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’ at common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. In substance, there is no difference between the two. At common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, ‘a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’ is a place to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> can, and do, have access.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>R v Wellard</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/38132-E-M.xml&#39;)">(1884) 14&nbsp;QBD 63</a>, the charge was one of indecent exposure at a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. Again, the place where the event occurred was private property. The court held that it was immaterial that the place was one where members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> do not have a strict legal right of access. It was sufficient if the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> did in fact have access to it without hindrance. It was in this context that Grove&nbsp;J said that the right to go there was not in question.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>PP v Chen Geok Len</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/35128-M.xml&#39;)">[1967] 1&nbsp;MLJ 59</a> concerned affray in a hotel. The hotel was held to be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. What is useful was the <em>dictum</em> by Lee Hun Hoe&nbsp;J at 60:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The meaning of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place, I think, depends to a great extent upon the context and upon the object of a particular Ordinance. A place may be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place at one time and not at other times.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Re Freestone</em> (1856) 1&nbsp;H &amp; N 93; 156&nbsp;ER 1131 held that a carriage on a railway was not a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place when the carriage was not being used at that time for the conveyance of passengers. Of course, back in those days, railway lines and carriages in England were private property. This case is to be contrasted with <em>Langrish v Archer</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/37706-E-M.xml&#39;)">(1882) 10&nbsp;QBD 44</a> where it was held that a railway carriage while travelling on its journey was an “open and <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place”. It mattered not that the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> had access to it only upon certain terms, <em>ie&nbsp;</em>buying a ticket. Both these cases involved gaming.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Brannan v Peek</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/60781-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1948] 1&nbsp;KB 68</a> held for the purposes of gaming that a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> house was not a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place because there was no right of entry, restricted or otherwise, into such premises. No reference was made to <em>R v Wellard</em>, and the correctness of this decision is doubtful. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> house is private property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other line of cases largely involved dangerous driving or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. In <em>R v Waters</em> (1963) 47&nbsp;Cr App R 149, it was held that for the purpose of the offence of being in charge of a vehicle in a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place when unfit through drink, a privately owned car park was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place if the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> had access to it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if there was no evidence that the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> actually went to the private land, then the private land could not be said to be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place within the meaning of the English Road Safety Act&nbsp;1967. This was so held in <em>Pugh v Knipe</em> [1972] RTR 286.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that none of the cases cited by counsel for the appellant dealt with <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> property. All of them involved the question of when private property could be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place within the meaning of the respective legislation the cases were concerned with. However, this test was not restricted to private property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Tulshi Das v King-Emperor</em> AIR 1924&nbsp;All 768 at&nbsp;769, Boys&nbsp;J said of the words “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place”:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The legislature has used words ‘in a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’ capable equally of including in their ordinary and proper meaning ‘a place the title to which is vested in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>’ and ‘a place to which, however owned, the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> is allowed in effect unrestricted access’.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys&nbsp;J was of the view at 769 that if the gaming had occurred in a place to which the title was vested in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>, there “can be no suggestion that an offence is not committed”. There does not appear to have been any authority cited for this proposition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although “a place the title to which is vested in the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>” is equally a natural meaning of the words “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” and is also consistent with s&nbsp;2 of the Act, which defines “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” as “including” places which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access to, none of the authorities appear to approach the interpretation of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” in this manner.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Melser v Police</em> [1967] NZLR 437, the disorderly conduct occurred on the grounds of the New Zealand Parliament House. Nevertheless, the court approached the question of whether it was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place by deciding that it was <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place in that it was a place which was open and was commonly used by the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span>. In <em>Bethune v Hefferman</em> [1986] VR 417, the Victoria court approached the question of whether the foyer of a police station was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place in the same manner. In <em>R v Burgess</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/31996-M.xml&#39;)">[1941] MLJ 123</a>, the road in question, Jalan Kayu, was owned by the Air Ministry, yet the same approach was used. While these cases did not decide that it is illegitimate to hold that a place is a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place merely because it is <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> property, it does suggest that this is not the proper approach.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the meaning of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” is too well entrenched to allow the approach suggested by Boys&nbsp;J. While the meaning of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” is not always clear, I am of the view that it is pretty well settled that the question revolves around whether the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access to the place, whether in fact or in right. Whether the land is owned by the State or some other <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> authority is not conclusive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to answer the question whether the site is a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place within the meaning of the Act, it is necessary to refer to a few other authorities. In <em>Ward v Marsh</em> [1959] VR 26, Lowe&nbsp;J said at&nbsp;27:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The starting point is, I think, the natural English meaning of the words ‘<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place’, which I think is also the common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> meaning and, since that meaning is generally available, even where the legislature or other authority gives an extended meaning, I propose to state it, as I understand it. In that sense (unless there is a context to indicate a different meaning) it covers every place to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> qua <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> may at the relevant time go. It is immaterial that none at such time is present. It is also immaterial how the right of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> to go to such place arises … But this conception of a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place was found too restricted for the purpose of restraining various evils which the legislature or other lawmaking body thought should be dealt with. Hence one finds that the natural meaning of the phrase has been largely extended … These latter considerations make it essential to consider what in each case is the mischief with which the legislature seeks to deal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” does not necessarily mean the same thing when used in different legislation, though the primary meaning is still a place where the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> can or do go. An example of how the words “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” can acquire an extraordinary meaning when construed according to its context is in the case of <em>R v Thallman</em> (1863) Le &amp; Ca&nbsp;326; 169&nbsp;ER 1416. There, the roof of a private building, to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> had no access and did not go, was held to be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place where the offence was one of indecent exposure in an open and <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. The roof was not even visible from any <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> highway and could only be seen from the windows of several other houses. It was held that it was enough that the people in those houses could see the act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in interpreting the words “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” in s&nbsp;20 of the Act, regard must be had to the object of s&nbsp;20. This is consistent with s&nbsp;9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap&nbsp;1, 1985 Rev Ed), which states that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the interpretation of a provision of a written <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must also have regard to the mischief which the Act is aimed at. In <em>Heydon’s Case</em> (1584) 3&nbsp;Co Rep 7a; 76&nbsp;ER 637 it was reported that the Exchequer made the following pertinent observations:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And it was resolved by them, that for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>), four things are to be discerned and considered:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">1st What was the common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> before the making of the Act?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">2nd What was the mischief and defect for which the common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> did not provide?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">3rd What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth; and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">4th The true reason of the remedy;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and <em>pro privato commodo</em>, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, <em>pro bono publico</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;9A(2) of the Interpretation Act (Cap&nbsp;1, 1985 Rev Ed) allows the court when construing an ambiguous provision to have regard to extrinsic matters, one of which is Parliamentary speeches. In <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report – 2nd&nbsp;Session of the 6th&nbsp;Parliament</em>, vol&nbsp;49 col&nbsp;1237, the then Minister for the Environment Dr&nbsp;Ahmad Mattar in moving the Bill which was to become the Act said at col&nbsp;1238:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, more stringent measures to deter dumping of refuse are necessary. It is important to eliminate such inconsiderate acts as illegal dumps can give rise to health hazards, for example, the breeding of mosquitoes and rodents. It also incurs needless <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> money to clear away such dumps. In 1986, for instance, 167 cases of illegal dumping were detected and a total of 220&nbsp;tonnes of refuse were removed from these sites by the Ministry of the Environment at a cost of $40,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can thus be seen that the purpose of s&nbsp;20 is to deter dumping. The mischief the Act aims at is the health hazards arising from such illegal dumps and the consequent injury to the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> purse resulting from the need to remove the rubbish. That being the case, whether the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access to the place or not is not relevant. If the title to the place is in the State, then <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> funds will have to be expended in removing the rubbish regardless of whether the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access to the place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the reasons I have stated, I am unable to hold that a place is a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place merely because it is state land. Apart from that, it seems to me that the intention of Parliament can only be served by giving the words “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” as wide an interpretation as is permissible under the Act and in the light of the authorities.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A particularly useful case is <em>Knox v Anderton</em> (1983) 76&nbsp;Cr App R&nbsp;156. There the upper landing of a block of flats was held to be a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place. The relevant statute there defined “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” to include a “place to which at the material time the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> have or are permitted to have access”. The Court of Appeal held that as there was nothing to stop members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> from entering the stairways of the blocks, no barrier to prevent members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> walking along the landings, no doors to the stairways or landings which were open to the atmosphere and no notice to suggest that there was any restriction of access except some notices on some buildings at the entrance of the estate stating, “Parking of vehicles above 10&nbsp;cwt on the estate is prohibited. Access is restricted to tenants and their visitors only”, the justices were entitled to come to the conclusion that the landings were a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Defence’s own witness testified that the Land Office would not stop anyone from walking on the site. The witness and the appellant had also testified that parts of the site were not fenced off so that any member of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> could enter upon the site on foot if they were so minded. That being the case, the district judge was entitled to find that the site was a place which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> had access to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2 of the Act extends the meaning of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” to any place where the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access. It does not matter whether members of the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> do in fact go there. It is sufficient if they have access to it. It would be quite contrary to Parliament’s intention to hold that despite the extension of the meaning of “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” in s&nbsp;2, the Prosecution must also show that the place is one where the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> do in fact go. It is in the very nature of the offence of illegal dumping that these activities often take place in vacant plots of land in relatively remote areas like Lorong Buangkok. These are land to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access but rarely go. The mischief which it is Parliament’s clear will to eliminate will remain if the court is to hold that these plots of land are not <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> places. Therefore, in my view, any place to which the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> has access is a “<span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place” for the purposes of s&nbsp;20 of the Act. Where it is state land, whether the <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> do in fact go there is irrelevant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district judge’s finding that the site was a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place was therefore justified. Whether the site is being maintained by the company is irrelevant to the question of whether it is a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to counsel for the appellant’s argument that the ingredients of dumping had not been made out. Counsel’s argument, in essence, was that, as the company was under a duty to maintain the site, it was ultimately obliged to remove the refuse deposited on it. In my view, this argument has absolutely no merit. The appellant had admitted in court that he had no right to occupy and was not in occupation of the site. He therefore knew that he had no right to deposit refuse on it, temporarily or otherwise. Whether the company was under an obligation under the maintenance contract to remove the refuse or not was irrelevant. The district judge was therefore justified in finding that the refuse had been disposed of at the site instead of the authorised dumping ground at Lorong Halus, under the ruse of maintaining the site.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, the appellant was rightly convicted of the offence. As there is no appeal against the $800 fine imposed, this aspect of the appeal must be dismissed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is then the question of the forfeiture order made against the vehicle. I have already set out above the relevant parts of s&nbsp;20. Section&nbsp;20 is, to put it mildly, not very well drafted. In the first place, so far as sub-s&nbsp;(4) is concerned, it is hard to see how a court can order the forfeiture of a vehicle used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence. The power can only be exercised by the “court on convicting any person of” an offence under sub-s&nbsp;(1). Conviction is therefore a prerequisite under sub-s&nbsp;(4).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, sub-s&nbsp;(5) allows a court to make “an order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection&nbsp;(4)”, so long as it is the court before which the prosecution with regard to the offence has been or will be held. Subsection&nbsp;(4) does not provide for the forfeiture of the vehicle except on the written application of the PP. If no written application is made by the PP, sub-s&nbsp;(4) does not empower the court to make a forfeiture order. It appears that in such cases, any forfeiture orders will have to be made under s&nbsp;386 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (Cap&nbsp;68). Subsection&nbsp;(4) states that the court “shall” make an order for forfeiture if the written application is made. However, sub-s&nbsp;(5) allows the court to make an order for the release of the vehicle notwithstanding that it is “liable to forfeiture under sub-s&nbsp;(4)”. Since there is only one instance when the court can order forfeiture of the vehicle under sub-s&nbsp;(4), that is on the written application of the PP, this suggests that sub-s&nbsp;(5) is granting the court the discretion whether to forfeit the vehicle. Subsection&nbsp;(5) is therefore irreconcilable with sub-s&nbsp;(4) if the word “shall” in sub-s&nbsp;(4) is used in the mandatory sense. This points to the conclusion that the word “shall” in sub-s&nbsp;(4) is used in the directory sense.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a reading of sub-ss&nbsp;(6), (7) and (8) reveals that if no prosecution is made, the owner of the vehicle may make a claim for the vehicle. However, if a prosecution is mounted, there is no provision for the owner of the vehicle to make a claim for it notwithstanding that there is no conviction. This suggests that the court should have the discretion whether to release the vehicle or order its forfeiture in such a case, especially since the alleged offender is not necessarily the owner and the prosecution may be frivolous. Similarly even where there is a conviction the owner may be entirely innocent of the offender’s wrongdoing. The vehicle may have been hired or in an extreme case stolen. If the Legislature intends to take this decision away from the court and vest it in the Commissioner, it should do so in the clearest of language. Parliament has not done so. In this case, s&nbsp;20(4) read in conjunction with s&nbsp;20(5) is far from clear. On the contrary, it suggests that the court retains the discretion. I therefore conclude that notwithstanding the use of the word “shall” in s&nbsp;20(4), the court nevertheless retains the discretion whether or not to make a forfeiture order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>PP v Gue Song Yam</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0060.xml&#39;)">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 60</a> at&nbsp;[20], I expressed the view in respect of s&nbsp;42 of the Act that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I cannot believe that the intention of the legislation can be to deprive offenders of all the implements with which they committed the offence regardless of the proportionality of that deprivation to the offence in order to ensure that they do not offend again. The maximum fine of only $1,000 that is imposed in s&nbsp;42(1) of the Act is supposed to constitute a just and effective deterrent against further commissions of similar offences. The confiscation powers in s&nbsp;42(8) merely act to supplement this, and it can hardly be possible to fit into this context the forfeiture of a van, the value of which is out of all proportion to the maximum fine fixed by <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That view is applicable here in respect of s&nbsp;20. In this case, forfeiture of the vehicle, which is not even owned by the appellant, would be out of all proportion to the offence committed by the appellant. I understand that the value of a vehicle such as the one in this case easily exceeds $100,000. Ordering its forfeiture would amount to imposing an additional fine exceeding $100,000 on the appellant in addition to the $800 already imposed. That would be quite wrong. I would therefore set aside the forfeiture order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I will allow this appeal in part. The appellant’s conviction and the $800 fine imposed on him stands. However, the forfeiture of the vehicle is hereby set aside.</p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy">Headnoted by Loh Tann Ling.</p> </div></content></root></maincontent></maincontent><br> <br> </div> <p><a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1995]%201%20SLR(R)%200757.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#anomagicid" class="goTop floatRight">Back to top</a></p> <p class="pageContentCopyright"> </p><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Singapore Academy of Law.</p> <p></p> <!-- Content Details Body Ends --> </div><!-- Result Display Ends --> <div class="annotator-outer annotator-viewer annotator-hide">
