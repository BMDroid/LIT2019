On 26&nbsp;September 1987, the detention order was suspended subject to the applicant executing a bond and complying with certain conditions. On 19&nbsp;April 1988, the Minister exercised his powers under s&nbsp;10 of the ISA and revoked the suspension, such that the applicant was detained once again.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">On 22&nbsp;April 1988, the applicant applied for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. This was heard and dismissed by the High Court, although her appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of the President’s satisfaction. In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeal applied a subjective test of satisfaction under s&nbsp;8(1) of the ISA.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">The applicant was thus released on 8&nbsp;December 1988. However, the applicant was immediately rearrested under a new detention order on the same day.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">In January 1989, Parliament amended Art&nbsp;149 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985&nbsp;Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”) and added four new provisions (ss&nbsp;8A to 8D) to the ISA. Section&nbsp;8B of the ISA reaffirmed the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> as laid down in <em>Lee Mau Seng v Minister for Home Affairs</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1971-1973] SLR(R) 0135.xml&#39;)">[1971–1973] SLR(R) 135</a> (“<em>Lee Mau Seng</em>”), <em>viz</em> that a subjective test applied to determine the President’s satisfaction under s&nbsp;8(1) of the ISA. The court in <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> also held that <em>mala fides</em> or bad faith was not a justiciable issue in the context of the ISA.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">Two issues were raised in the present case. First, whether the purported amendments to the Constitution and the ISA had the effect of depriving the applicant of her right to effective judicial review of the legality, rationality and constitutionality of her detention under the ISA. Second, if so, whether the amendments contravened the Constitution such that they were void.</p> <p class="HN-Heading">Held, dismissing the motion:</p> <p class="HN-Held">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purported amendments to the Constitution and the ISA had the effect of depriving the applicant of her right to judicial review of her detention under the ISA. The new s&nbsp;8B(1) of the ISA reaffirmed the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> governing judicial discretion as laid down in <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> that the subjective test applied in determining the proper exercise of the discretionary power of the President or the Minister under the ISA.

The application was heard by the High Court by Lai Kew Chai&nbsp;J and the application was dismissed on 2&nbsp;August&nbsp;1988 (see <em>Teo Soh Lung v Minister of Home Affairs</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1988] 2 SLR(R) 0030.xml&#39;)">[1988] 2 SLR(R) 30</a>). The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal No&nbsp;81 of 1988) (see <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister of Home Affairs</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1988] 2 SLR(R) 0525.xml&#39;)">[1988] 2 SLR(R) 525</a>) and on 8&nbsp;December&nbsp;1988, her appeal was allowed on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence of the President’s satisfaction as required under s&nbsp;8(1) of the ISA. An order for her immediate release was made. In the appeal, legal issues were raised on the applicant’s behalf. Although the Court of Appeal did not adjudicate upon them, it did, however, deal with them. A summary of its conclusions is set out in the judgment. The conclusion which is relevant to the present proceedings is conclusion (f) (at [139]) where the Court of Appeal stated that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The President’s satisfaction under s&nbsp;8 of the ISA and the Minister’s satisfaction under s&nbsp;10 of the ISA are both reviewable by a court of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> as:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the subjective test adopted in <em>Karam Singh</em> and its progeny can no longer be supported and the objective test is applicable upon a judicial review of the exercise of these discretion;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order for release was served on the officer in charge of the Whitley Road Centre at about 4.40pm the same day. At about 4.45pm the same day, the applicant was placed in a car and driven out of the gate of the Whitley Road Centre for a few hundred metres. The applicant was then served with a new detention order dated 8&nbsp;December&nbsp;1988, for the period 8&nbsp;December&nbsp;1988 to 19&nbsp;June&nbsp;1989 and arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain events which occurred in Parliament in January&nbsp;1989 are relevant to the submissions of counsel for the applicant. On 16&nbsp;January&nbsp;1989, the Government introduced two measures in Parliament: the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 (Act&nbsp;1 of 1989) which was passed by Parliament on 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;1989, and came into operation on 27&nbsp;January&nbsp;1989; the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 (Act&nbsp;2 of 1989) which was passed by Parliament on 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;1989, and came into operation on 30&nbsp;January&nbsp;1989.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Act No&nbsp;1 of 1989, Art&nbsp;149 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (“the Constitution”) was amended. The article as amended provides as follows (the amendment is in italics):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether … inside or outside Singapore —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cause, or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear, organized violence against persons or property;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to excite disaffection against the President or the Government;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of anything by <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> established;

In <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> the applicant applied for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. He was arrested without a warrant by a police officer and an order for detention was made by the Minister for Home Affairs under s&nbsp;8(1) of the Internal Security Act directing that he be forthwith detained for a period of two years. The decision of the High Court was that the sufficiency and relevancy of the consideration upon which the Executive detained the applicant under s&nbsp;8(1) of the ISA were matters for the subjective satisfaction of “the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet” (the subjective test). The court also held that “<em>mala fides</em>” or bad faith is not a justiciable issue in the context of the ISA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester&nbsp;QC says that but for the amendments made to Art&nbsp;149 of the Constitution and to the ISA, the applicant would undoubtedly have been entitled to rely on the Court of Appeal’s judgment in her favour on the relevant issues of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> both when challenging the new detention order of 8&nbsp;December&nbsp;1988, and when seeking damages for tortious conduct in relation to her previous detention in the action instituted before the commencement of the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. Two main questions were raised by Mr&nbsp;Lester:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do the purported amendments have the effect of depriving Teo Soh Lung of the right to effective judicial review of the legality, the rationality, and the constitutionality … of her detention purported under the ISA?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if so, are they valid amendments, or are they contrary to the supreme <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of the Constitution and therefore void?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first question</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester’s submission is that the amendments do not have the effect of depriving the applicant of the right to judicial review of the legality, the rationality, and the constitutionality of her detention under the ISA. Mr&nbsp;Lester argues that nothing in Art&nbsp;149 as amended of itself prevents the courts from reviewing the legality, rationality and constitutionality of the new or the prior detention orders. Section&nbsp;8A defines “judicial review” in very broad terms in an attempt to destroy the applicant’s pending legal proceedings. It expressly covers not only the present application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, but also the application for judicial review and the action for damages instituted before the commencement of the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that ss&nbsp;8B(1) and 8B(2) do not cover the present application. The applicant does not seek judicial review of any act done or decision made by the President or the minister in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the minister by the provisions of the ISA or under the provisions of the ISA. She seeks the judicial review of acts and decisions of the President or the minister which purport to have been done or purport to have been made in pursuance of the powers conferred by s&nbsp;8 of the ISA or under the provisions of the ISA but which were in fact done for improper purposes and in a manner which was illegal, irrational and unconstitutional and beyond the scope of the powers conferred by the ISA and hence null and void. Mr&nbsp;Lester cites the House of Lords case of <em>Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/65704-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1969] 2&nbsp;AC 147</a> as the leading case on the principles to be applied on the construction of statutory provisions ousting or limiting the ordinary jurisdiction of the court. The Privy Council, says Mr&nbsp;Lester, has also stated its approval of the principle in <em>Anisminic</em> in the case of <em>Endell Thomas v A-G of Trinidad and Tobago</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67692-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1982] AC&nbsp;113</a>. Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that the principle of strict construction applies to the new ss&nbsp;8A and 8B of the ISA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester says that s&nbsp;8B(1) is plain and unambiguous. It expressly refers to any decision made or act done “in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the minister by the provisions of the Act”. Mr&nbsp;Lester argues that it has no application to a decision made or act done otherwise than in pursuance of any such power. Accordingly, subject to s&nbsp;8B(2), the court is not prevented from applying the legal principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal in its judgment of 8&nbsp;December&nbsp;1988, in adjudicating upon the applicant’s challenge to the purported decisions and acts of the President and the minister, outside the proper scope of their statutory powers. Mr&nbsp;Lester says as regards s&nbsp;8B(2), it refers to “any act or decision made by the President or the minister under the provisions of the Act”. He argues that an “act or decision” refers to a real act or decision and does not include an apparent or purported act or decision, which is a nullity. Accordingly, the ouster clause in s&nbsp;8B(2) does not bar the present application. Mr&nbsp;Lester states that the nature of the applicant’s case is that, in purporting to make their decisions and to act, the minister and the President (acting on the advice of the Cabinet: Art&nbsp;21 of the Constitution) have misconstrued s&nbsp;8 and s&nbsp;10 of the ISA, have acted in bad faith and for improper purposes, have had regard to irrelevancies, have disregarded relevant considerations and have acted outside the scope of the ISA. He submits nothing in s&nbsp;8B(2) prevents the court from adjudicating upon the merits of that claim, in the light of all the evidence which is before the court. So much for the arguments and submissions of Mr&nbsp;Lester.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister of Home Affairs</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_3">[3]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) allowed the applicant’s appeal solely on the technical ground that the respondents had not adduced admissible evidence of the President’s satisfaction. What constituted admissible evidence under s&nbsp;8 of the ISA is the only <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the case. All other matters mentioned in the court’s conclusions are <em>obiter dicta</em>. Those observations of the Court of Appeal on the applicability of the objective test, evidence of national security, <em>Karam Singh v Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/35717-M.xml&#39;)">[1969] 2&nbsp;MLJ 129</a>, review on the grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety, and burden of proof, <em>etc</em> cannot apply to the present proceedings in the light of the new ss&nbsp;8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA. Section&nbsp;8B(1) clearly lays down that the subjective test applies to the exercise of the powers pursuant to ss&nbsp;8 and 10 of the ISA and s&nbsp;8B(2) provides that there is to be judicial review only in regard to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such act or decision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of proof is on the applicant to prove that her detention is unlawful as the respondents have produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President acting on the advice of the Cabinet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said the new s&nbsp;8B(1) reaffirms the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> governing judicial review as laid down in <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_8">[8]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) that the subjective test applies in determining the proper exercise of the discretionary power of the President or the minister under the ISA. In the light of this new provision any principles inconsistent with the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> laid down in <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> cannot apply to the present case. The respondents cannot be required to adduce any other evidence apart from the grounds and allegations of fact to prove to the court that their decision was in fact based on national security considerations. Any such requirement would be contrary to s&nbsp;8B(2).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant’s challenge on the grounds of <em>mala fides</em> and improper purpose cannot be raised in the present proceedings. In <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> the court held that “<em>mala fides”</em> or bad faith is not a justiciable issue in the context of the ISA and the power conferred by the Act on the President who had to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of the order of detention if he is satisfied under the Act that it is necessary to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester has urged that the proper legal principles to be applied in the present case are those enunciated in <em>Anisminic</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_11">[11]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). I am of the view that the principles in <em>Anisminic</em> are not applicable to the present case. <em>Anisminic</em> at most decided that there was a presumption that the court was not precluded from inquiry whether a decision of a tribunal was acting outside its jurisdiction. In that case their Lordships recognised that whether any nullity or lack of jurisdiction had arisen depended on the interpretatory power conferred upon the tribunal. The question therefore was whether the tribunal in making its decision had stayed within the mandate given to it by Parliament. It is clear that in the view of the Privy Council in <em>Endell Thomas v A-G of Trinidad and Tobago</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_11">[11]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) that a situation would only fall outside the jurisdiction of an authority on the <em>Anisminic</em> principles only if the authority did something obviously outside the powers conferred on it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Anisminic</em> it was clear from the legislation in question that Parliament had not conferred on the Commission the power to define persons qualified to recover compensation. Parliament had exhaustively laid down the criteria defining persons qualified to recover compensation. On a proper interpretation of the legislation, a person was qualified to recover compensation on the sole condition that he was a British national. The Commission was not empowered to require the further qualification that the assignee had to be a British national as well. The scheme of the legislation merely enabled the Commission to administer compensation within fixed and determined limits which the Legislature itself had laid down. The preclusive clause could not, therefore, have any application except to a determination made within the limits of the definitions, conditions and prescribed matters fixed by Parliament.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme under the ISA is clearly different. Parliament has left to the Cabinet and the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to determine whether it is necessary in the interests of national security to detain a person. Parliament has not sought in the ISA to define activities which are prejudicial to national security. It is for the Executive to determine as a matter of policy and judgment whether certain activities are prejudicial to national security.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the Executive has acted upon its jurisdiction conferred by Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs in his affidavit has stated that the Cabinet and the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet were satisfied that the applicant had acted in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore by being involved in a Marxist conspiracy to subvert the existing social order with a view to establishing a socialist state. To allow the court to investigate into the good faith or otherwise of the President who was to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet in arriving at his satisfaction would be inconsistent with the scheme intended by Parliament. Section&nbsp;11 of the ISA provides that a person detained under s&nbsp;8 may make representations against his detention order. Section&nbsp;12(2) provides that upon considering the recommendation of the advisory board, the President may give the minister such direction, if any, as he thinks fit regarding the order made by the minister and every decision of the President therein would be final and shall not be called in question in any court. The answer to Mr&nbsp;Lester’s first question is, therefore, “Yes”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second question</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The submission of Mr&nbsp;Lester is that the purported amendments to Art&nbsp;149 of the Constitution are contrary to the supreme <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of the Constitution and are not valid amendments. On the assumption that the purported amendments to Art&nbsp;149 are valid, he submits the purported amendments to s&nbsp;8 of the ISA do not come within the legislative powers conferred by Art&nbsp;149 as amended and are <em>ultra vires</em> Art&nbsp;149 as amended and therefore void.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester’s argument is this. The ISA was made pursuant to Art&nbsp;149 rather than Art&nbsp;58(1) of the Constitution. As regards the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989, it purports to have been made pursuant to Art&nbsp;149(3) of the Constitution. Article&nbsp;149 is therefore the empowering provision. Article&nbsp;149, both in its original and in its amended form, severely derogates from the fundamental rights and freedom of the individual, guaranteed by Pt&nbsp;IV of the Constitution. As such, it should be given a strict interpretation against the state and a generous interpretation in favour of the individual. (See <em>Ong Ah Chuan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1979-1980] SLR(R) 0710.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1979-1980] SLR(R) 0710.xml&#39;)">[1979–1980] SLR(R) 710</a>.)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unamended Art&nbsp;149(1) provides that, if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside Singapore, of the kind specified in Arts&nbsp;149(1)(<em>a</em>) to (<em>e</em>) “any provision of that <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with art&nbsp;9, 13 or 14, or would, apart from this Article, be outside the legislative Power of Parliament”. Mr&nbsp;Lester contends that the unamended Art&nbsp;149(1) thus validates only a particular provision of a <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, and it does so only if that provision is “designed to stop or prevent” subversive action of the kind specified in (<em>a</em>) to (<em>e</em>) of Art&nbsp;149(1).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to Art&nbsp;149(1) adds “any amendment to that <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> or any provision in any <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> enacted under the provisions of clause (3)”. Each of these two further limbs is governed, says Mr&nbsp;Lester, by the overriding requirement that the amendment or the provision in question are themselves “designed to stop or prevent” subversive action of the kind specified in Arts&nbsp;149(1)(<em>a</em>) to&nbsp;(<em>e</em>). Mr&nbsp;Lester argues that if the amendment or provision, purporting to be made under the new Art&nbsp;149(3) is not designed to stop or prevent subversive action of the kind specified in Art&nbsp;149(1), it is <em>ultra vires</em>. Mr&nbsp;Lester contends that Art&nbsp;149(3) and the amendments to the ISA should not be construed literally but purposively, having regard to the character and origin of the Constitution, to the <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution as a whole, to the context in which Art&nbsp;149 is placed and to the need for a generous interpretation in favour of individual freedom, then Art&nbsp;149(3) cannot possibly be given an arbitrary and irrational interpretation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester says that it is significant that Art&nbsp;149 is included in Pt&nbsp;XII of the Constitution, which is entitled “Special Powers Against Subversion and Emergency Powers”. The powers which it confers are special and to be used only against subversion. The legislative powers conferred by Art&nbsp;149 are in derogation from fundamental rights and freedoms and as such, they should be construed strictly, allowing no greater derogation than is necessary in the interests of national security. Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that the proper approach as regards the interpretation of the legislative powers conferred by Art&nbsp;149 as amended is reflected in the Report of the Federation of Malaya <span class="blueHighlight">Constitutional</span> Commission 1957, chaired by Lord&nbsp;Reid, which observed:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… but Parliament should not be entitled to authorize infringements of such a character that they cannot properly be regarded as designed to deal with the particular situation. It would be open to any person aggrieved by the enactment of a particular infringement to maintain that it could not properly be so regarded and to submit the question for decision by the court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that the legislative powers conferred by Art&nbsp;149 as amended does not authorise legislation which sanctions or facilitates the misuse of the powers conferred by the ISA in a manner or for purposes other than to stop or prevent subversive action of the type prescribed by Art&nbsp;149(1). Mr&nbsp;Lester contends that the aims and the purported effects of the amendments to Art&nbsp;149 of the Constitution and to s&nbsp;8 of the ISA by the addition of ss&nbsp;8A, 8B, 8C and 8D are:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deprive the applicant of the fruits of her victory on the central legal issues in the Court of Appeal, and to do so retrospectively;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to destroy all the applicant’s pending legal proceedings;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to authorize the applicant’s arbitrary detention;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to retrospectively deny to the applicant the right to appeal to the Privy Council in these proceedings and in any other pending or future proceedings and in any other pending or future proceedings in respect of any of her periods of detention, thereby to discriminate against her by denying her the right to the equal protection of the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, as provided for in art&nbsp;12(1) of the Constitution;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deny to the applicant not only the protection of the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> interpreted and applied by an independent and impartial judiciary, but also the protection of the specially entrenched fundamental liberties enshrined in arts&nbsp;11(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution; and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to violate the separation of powers, guaranteed by the Constitution, as between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, by usurping the power of the independent judiciary for the impartial determination on the justiciable question whether the executive’s decision in any particular case was in fact based upon national security considerations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that these amendments fall outside the legislative powers conferred by Art&nbsp;149 as amended, because they are not designed to stop or prevent subversive action of the kind specified in Art&nbsp;149(1), Mr&nbsp;Lester says they purport to immunise from judicial review acts done and decisions made in bad faith, for improper purposes, irrelevant to the stopping or prevention of subversive action. They purport retrospectively to deprive the applicant of the benefit of the Court of Appeal’s decision and of the right of appeal to the Privy Council in respect of her pending as well as any future claims. None of them is designed to stop or prevent subversive action. Each of them is designed to authorise arbitrary acts and decisions outside the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. They are therefore <em>ultra vires</em> and void and do not debar the applicant’s claim to <em>habeas corpus</em>. Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that the purported amendments to the Constitution are invalid. Mr&nbsp;Lester’s arguments are as follows.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;4 of the Constitution provides that “This Constitution is the supreme <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of the Republic of Singapore and any <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> enacted by the legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution, to the extent of the inconsistency be void.” Article&nbsp;5(1) of the Constitution provides that, “Subject to this Article and Article&nbsp;8, the provisions of this Constitution may be amended by a <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> enacted by the legislature.” Article&nbsp;5(2) of the Constitution provides that “A Bill seeking to amend any provision in this Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament unless it has been supported on Second and Third Readings by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number of the Members thereof.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant does not dispute that in the present case the requirements of Art&nbsp;5(2) have been satisfied. The applicant, however, does dispute that s&nbsp;3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 read on its own and read with the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989, constitutes a “<span class="blueHighlight">law</span>” within the meaning of Art&nbsp;5(1). Mr&nbsp;Lester contends that the Legislature is empowered only to enact <span class="blueHighlight">laws</span>. Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that the amendments which have been made are not the enactment of a “<span class="blueHighlight">law</span>” within the meaning of Art&nbsp;5(1). He argues that the amendments amount to a direction that the applicant’s pending proceedings (the civil claim for damages in tort, the stayed application for judicial review and the present application for <em>habeas corpus</em>) must fail and should be discharged. They are a direct disposal of her proceedings by the Legislature itself, and are therefore judicial acts and not the enactment of a “<span class="blueHighlight">law</span>” within the meaning of Art&nbsp;5(1).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester further submits that Parliament’s powers to amend the Constitution are limited not only by the express provisions of Art&nbsp;5 but also by implied limitations upon the amending power which are derived from the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution itself. Mr&nbsp;Lester says that the Privy Council has not had occasion to decide this fundamental question about implied limitations upon the power to amend a written constitution so as to damage the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> features of the Constitution or so as to destroy its <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span>. Mr&nbsp;Lester, however, relies on two decisions of the Supreme Court of India: <em>Minerva Mills Ltd v Union of India</em> [1981] 1&nbsp;SCR 206 and <em>P Sambamurthy v State of Andhra Pradesh</em> AIR 1987&nbsp;SC 663.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Lester contends that in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_22">[22]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) the Privy Council made it clear that the Singapore Constitution is founded on the Westminster model and incorporates the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, including the fundamental rules of natural justice. Mr&nbsp;Lester also contends that in <em>Moses Hinds v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67058-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1977] AC&nbsp;195</a> the Privy Council made it clear that the Singapore Constitution embodies the “<span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> principle of separation of powers” including preserving the exclusive functions of the courts in exercising judicial power. Mr&nbsp;Lester submits that Parliament is not empowered to amend the Constitution in a manner which has violated the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution and exceeded its legislative powers by:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usurping judicial power exclusively vested in the judiciary, in breach of the separation of powers;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depriving the applicant of the protection of the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, including the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, as regards the matters of which she has complained in the pending and present proceedings;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without recourse to judicial review under the Constitution or at common <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> (except for failure to comply with purely procedural requirements);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorising the applicant to be punished by being detained without trial, even though she has committed no wrongdoing and even though her detention and punishment are for improper purposes;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acting retrospectively; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enacting what is in essence a conclusive and retrospective legislative judgment that the Executive is entitled, whatever the true facts of the applicant’s case, to detain her on grounds which may be improper and irrelevant or punitive and discriminatory, without liability in private <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> or in public <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the arguments and submissions of Mr&nbsp;Lester made on behalf of the applicant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Minerva Mills Ltd</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_30">[30]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) the Supreme Court of India agreed with the majority view in <em>Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala</em> AIR 1973&nbsp;SC 1461 that every provision of the Indian Constitution could be amended by Parliament provided in the result the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> foundation and <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution remained the same (“ the <em>Kesavananda</em> doctrine”). Ray&nbsp;J (one of the dissenting judges) in <em>Kesavananda</em> said that since <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> is the source of all legal validity and is itself always valid, “an amendment being the Constitution itself can never be invalid. An amendment is made if the procedure is complied with. Once the procedure is complied with it is a part of the Constitution” (at para&nbsp;788). Ray&nbsp;J also said at para&nbsp;1078:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The power to amend is wide and unlimited. The power to amend means the power to add, alter or repeal any provision of the Constitution.

In the words of Ray&nbsp;J in <em>Kesavananda</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_33">[33]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) (at para&nbsp;932):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fundamental or <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> principles can be changed.

Raja Azlan Shah&nbsp;FJ (as he then was) held that any provision of the Constitution could be amended under Art&nbsp;159.

Referring to the doctrine of implied restrictions on the power of <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendment, he said (at&nbsp;190):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A short answer to the fallacy of this doctrine is that it concedes to the court a more potent power of <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendment through judicial legislation than the organ for and clearly chosen by the Constitution for the exercise of the amending power.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question, can an amendment of a clause in the Constitution operate with retrospective effect, he said (at 190):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as an Act of Parliament is concerned, the rule of construction is that in order to determine whether it is retrospective in its operation, the language of the Act itself must be looked into bearing in mind that an Act is not to be construed retrospectively unless it is clear that such was the intention of Parliament. <em>If such was the intention that the Act was to be given retrospective effect even in respect of substantive right or pending proceeding, the courts have no alternative but to give effect to the Act even though the consequences might appear harsh and unjust</em>.

First, does Parliament have power to make <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendments that are inconsistent with the Constitution? Second, if Parliament has power to make <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendments that are inconsistent with the Constitution, do they have power to make amendments that destroy the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution? Having considered these questions the Federal Court summarised their answers thus at 75:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… first, Parliament have power to make <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendments that are inconsistent with the Constitution. Secondly, Parliament may amend the Constitution in any way they think fit, provided they comply with all the conditions precedent and subsequent regarding manner and form prescribed by the Constitution itself and it is unnecessary for us to say whether or not Parliament’s power of <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendment extends to destroying the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the <em>Kesavananda</em> doctrine is not applicable to our Constitution. Considering the differences in the making of the Indian and our Constitution, it cannot be said that our Parliament’s power to amend our Constitution is limited in the same way as the Indian Parliament’s power to amend the Indian Constitution. In any case, in my judgment, none of the amendments complained of has destroyed the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution. Mr&nbsp;Lester in the course of his argument enumerated the manner in which, in his submission, Parliament has violated the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution. However, I am of the view, that they do not violate the <span class="blueHighlight">basic</span> <span class="blueHighlight">structure</span> of the Constitution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjective test in ISA cases had for many years served the national security interests of Singapore to deal with subversion. The amendments are to reaffirm the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> which the courts had followed since <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_8">[8]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) until the decision of the Court of Appeal in December&nbsp;1988. The amendments touching on Arts&nbsp;11, 12 and 93 are only intended to ensure that the clear intent of Parliament is not disregarded. There is nothing in the amendments which is unrelated to the requirements of national security. A reaffirmation of principles laid down by the courts cannot be said to be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. There is no abrogation of judicial power. It is erroneous to contend that the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> has been abolished by legislation and that Parliament has stated its absolute and conclusive judgment in applications for judicial review or other actions. Parliament has done no more than to enact the rule of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> relating to the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> applicable to judicial review. The legislation does not direct the court to enter a particular judgment or dismiss a particular case. The court is left to deal with the case on the basis of the amendments. Legislation designed against subversion must necessarily include provisions to ensure the effectiveness of preventive detention. The amendments are intended to do just that.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether a particular provision in any <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> enacted pursuant to Art&nbsp;149 is designed to deal with a particular situation is non-justiciable. Preventive detention relates to national security which is the responsibility of the Executive. It is clear from the Constitution and the ISA, especially after the recent amendments, that the intention of Parliament is that whether preventive detention is necessary in a particular case is left to the subjective satisfaction of the Executive. In <em>The Zamora</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/52166-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1916] 2&nbsp;AC 77</a> Lord&nbsp;Parker said (at 107):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Those who are responsible for the national security must be the sole judges of what the national security requires. It would be obviously undesirable that such matters should be made the subject of evidence in a Court of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> or otherwise discussed in public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above passage was cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Malaysia in <em>Minister for Home Affairs</em>, <em>Malaysia v Karpal Singh</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/40691-M.xml&#39;)">[1988] 3&nbsp;MLJ 29</a>. In <em>R v Halliday</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/52586-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1917] AC&nbsp;260</a>, the appellant, a naturalised British subject of German birth was interned under reg&nbsp;14B made under the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act 1914. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that reg&nbsp;14B was not authorised by the Act and was <em>ultra vires</em>. The regulations were to be for preventive purposes. Lord&nbsp;Finlay LC said (at 269):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems obvious that no tribunal for investigating the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting some restraint can be imagined less appropriate than a Court of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service</em> [1984] 3&nbsp;All ER 935 Lord&nbsp;Diplock said (at 952):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… National security is the responsibility of the executive government; what action is needed to protect its interest is, as the cases cited by my noble and learned friend Lord&nbsp;Roskill establish and common sense itself dictates, a matter on which those on whom the responsibility rests, and not the courts of justice, must have the last word. It is par excellence a non-justiciable question. The judicial process is totally inept to deal with the sort of problems which it involves.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the amended Art&nbsp;149(1), the new ss&nbsp;8A, 8B, 8C and 8D of the ISA are valid notwithstanding that they are inconsistent with Arts&nbsp;9, 11, 12, 13 or 14 of the Constitution or would, apart from Art&nbsp;149, be outside the legislative power of Parliament. In any case, Art&nbsp;11(1) protects a person against retrospective criminal <span class="blueHighlight">laws</span> and repeated trials. The ISA is not a criminal <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> nor does the question of repeated trials arise in the present case. Preventive detention is clearly not a penal or criminal matter (see <em>Yeap Hock Seng v Minister for Home Affairs</em>, <em>Malaysia</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/37192-M.xml&#39;)">[1975] 2&nbsp;MLJ 279</a>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the new Art&nbsp;149(3), nothing in Art&nbsp;93 is to invalidate the provisions of the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. Since Parliament has decided that the subjective test, which has applied to ISA cases all along until the Court of Appeal judgment of December&nbsp;1988, should continue to apply to such cases, Parliament is entitled, in the interest of national security, to decide that the subjective test should apply to all cases, past, present and future. It cannot be said that the decision of Parliament is unreasonable in the circumstances. There is nothing discriminatory about the changes; nor do the changes amount to usurpation of judicial power.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Loh Kooi Choon</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1989]%201%20SLR(R)%200461.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(constitutional%20law%20basic%20structure)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_38">[38]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) the appellant had been arrested and detained under a warrant issued under the provisions of the Restricted Residence Enactment. He had not been produced before a magistrate within 24hrs of his arrest. He claimed damages but it was held that no action could be brought against the police officer as he was acting in compliance with a warrant issued by a competent authority. He appealed but before the appeal was heard the Federal Constitution was amended by Act A354/76 which provided in effect that Art&nbsp;5(4) of the Constitution shall not apply to the arrest or detention of any person under the existing <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> relating to restricted residence and that this amendment shall have effect from Merdeka Day. It was argued that the amendment was unconstitutional. It was held by the Federal Court that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament can alter the entrenched provisions of Art&nbsp;5(4) to remove the provision relating to the production before a magistrate of any arrested person under the Restricted Residence Enactment as long as the process of <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> amendment as laid down in Art&nbsp;159(3) is complied with. When that is done it becomes an integral part of the Constitution; it is the supreme <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>, and accordingly it cannot be said to be at variance with itself.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Parliament retrospectively affects vested rights or pending proceedings, then it would be the duty of an appellate court to apply the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> prevailing on the date of appeal before it. Subject to the <span class="blueHighlight">constitutional</span> limitation of Art&nbsp;7 of the Constitution, to wit, protection against retrospective criminal <span class="blueHighlight">laws</span> and repeated trials, Parliament would be within the ambit of its competence if it deems fit to legislate retrospectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Art&nbsp;149(1) also renders the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with Art&nbsp;12. In any case the new ss&nbsp;8A, 8B, 8C and 8D, and s&nbsp;10 of the ISA are not inconsistent with Art&nbsp;12. The provisions are not discriminatory since they apply to all cases of preventive detention under the ISA without exception. The provisions apply to all persons who are under preventive detention to prevent them from doing acts prejudicial to the national security or public interest.

In any event, as I have said, the amended Art&nbsp;149(1) protects the validity of ss&nbsp;8C and 8D of the ISA against any inconsistency with Art&nbsp;12(1).

In my judgment Parliament has the power to amend any provision of the Constitution so long as the special procedure required for amendment is followed. Both the amendments to the Constitution and the Internal Security Act were passed by Parliament by more than the two thirds majority required.

The abolition of appeals to the Privy Council is a logical consequence of changed circumstances. The amendments are valid and the courts must give effect to them in judicial review proceedings involving ISA cases.
