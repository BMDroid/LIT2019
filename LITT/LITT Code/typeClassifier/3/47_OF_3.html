It is clear from the plain words of ss&nbsp;8 as well as 27 of the Act that the only relevant type of confusion for the purpose of grounding an opposition or an infringement action, is that which is</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">brought about by</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">the similarity between the competing marks and between the goods and services in relation to which the marks are used. Since this court’s decision in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, our courts have given effect to this statutory wording by applying what is now known as the “step-by-step” approach, as opposed to the competing “global appreciation approach” applied in Europe after</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1998] RPC 199</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”). Under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round. Under the global appreciation approach the elements of similarity between marks and goods or services, whilst still necessary ingredients in the confusion inquiry, are elided with other factors going towards the ultimate question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at 223–224, and</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1999] RPC 117</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”) at 132). Whilst there have been suggestions that the two approaches might be distinct without being different, we maintain this dichotomy and endorse the step-by-step approach as being conceptually neater and more systematic and, importantly, as being more aligned with the requirements imposed under our statute (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at [8]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed under Section 8(2)(b), the Applicants have to prove three elements, namely that the competing marks are similar; the goods are identical or similar; and, because of the foregoing, there is</span> a likelihood of confusion&nbsp;on the part of the public.<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; I</span>shall examine each element in turn.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Similarity of Marks: Principles</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte Ltd</i> <i>v Ferrero SpA</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr> ("<b><i>Sarika</i></b>") at [16] (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14932-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 2 SLR 941</a></nobr> ("Hai Tong") at [39]) held that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The decided cases have established that the court will consider three aspects of similarity, <i>viz</i>, visual, aural and conceptual similarity: <i>Polo (CA)</i> at [24]; <i>Mobil Petroleum Co., Inc v Hyundai Mobis</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> at [17].&nbsp; However, it is not a pre-requisite that all three aspects of similarity must be made out before there can be a finding of similarity between the sign and the mark: <i>Mediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0496.xml&#39;)">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496</a> at [32] ("<i>Mediacorp</i>").

The court will not compare the two marks side by side and examine them in detail, because “the person who is confused often makes comparison from memory removed in time and space from the marks” (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33], citing <em>Caterpillar</em> at [55]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Similarity of Marks: Analysis</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Similarity</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b> sets out the following approach to determine visual similarity between competing marks at [51]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">In the case of word marks, a determination of visual similarity typically involves looking at the (a) length of the marks; (b) structure of the marks (<em>i.e.</em>, whether there are the same number of words); and (c) whether the same letters are used in the marks (<em>Ozone Community</em> at [49], citing Bently &amp; Sherman, <em>Intellectual Property Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2009) at 865 (“<em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em>”)).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the approach of the High Court in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b> above as a starting point, it is immediately apparent that the Subject Mark is significantly longer than the Applicants’ Marks, comprising eleven Chinese characters and eight English words.&nbsp; The Applicants’ Marks on the other hand are much shorter in length, with two words and one character (T9408130F), three characters (T9600740E) or four characters (T9600741C).&nbsp; As for whether the same letters are used in the marks, it is observed that the phrase “RED SUN” appears in both the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ T9408130F.&nbsp; Other than this, the words and characters used in the competing marks are different.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enquiry also considers the issue of distinctiveness in the ordinary and non-technical sense, in accordance with <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [23].&nbsp;

The same phrase appears in bold font at the base of both marks and makes a lasting visual impact.&nbsp; Secondarily, the Chinese characters</span> <b>[Image 3 included*]</b> could also be distinctive and memorable in the Subject Mark, as they appear in relatively larger font than the remaining Chinese characters and are found at the top of the Subject Mark.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinctive and memorable component of the Applicants’ T9600740E and T9600741C, on the other hand, would be, respectively, the Chinese characters</span> <b>[Image 4 included*]</b> <span lang="EN-GB">and the circle-within-a-square device.&nbsp; The Japanese characters in T9600741C would probably not be as distinctive and memorable visually as the circle-within-a-square device because the Japanese language is generally less used than the English and Chinese languages in Singapore.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for technical distinctiveness, the Court of Appeal in <b><em><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></em></b> opined at [25] that <i>“a mark which has greater technical distinctiveness enjoys a high threshold before a competing sign will be considered dissimilar to it (Sarika at [36])”.</i>&nbsp; Lim Han Tee averred in his statutory declaration at [32] that <i>“The words ‘RED SUN’ bear no meaning whatsoever in relation to the Applicant’s Products in question, which are health products and supplements and tea.&nbsp; It does not make sense for the Respondent to claim that ‘RED SUN’ is not distinctive of the Applicant simply because ‘RED’ and ‘SUN’ are common English words.”</i>&nbsp; I am inclined to find that the Applicants’ Marks fall within the category of marks which enjoys a fair degree of technical distinctiveness, as there is no direct, or even indirect, reference to the goods claimed as far as the evidence discloses.&nbsp; As such, it would take relatively more before a competing sign will be considered dissimilar to the Applicants’ Marks.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account the most distinctive and memorable component of both the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ T9408130F, that is, the phrase “RED SUN” and bearing in mind that there is a high threshold to cross before these marks are distinguished, I do not think that the other elements in the Subject Mark (such as the Chinese characters and oval sun device) suffice to differentiate the marks.&nbsp; In terms of visual perception of the competing marks, therefore, I find that the Subject Mark is similar to the Applicants’ T9408130F.&nbsp; However, the Subject Mark is not visually similar to the Applicants’ T9600740E and T9600741C because their distinctive and memorable components are rather different.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural Similarity</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A determination of aural similarity involves, as the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> opined at [28], "<i>a qualitative assessment of the relative number of syllables which the two marks have in common</i>".&nbsp; At [30]-[31], the court also endorsed the consideration of "<i>how an average Singaporean consumer would pronounce the respective words</i>" and the making of "<i>allowances for imperfect recollection and careless pronunciation and speech</i>".</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On</span> <span lang="EN-GB">"<i>a qualitative assessment of the relative number of syllables which the two marks have in common</i>", the Subject Mark has nineteen syllables (eleven syllables from the eleven Chinese characters and eight syllables from the English words) whilst the Applicants’ Marks have three (T9408130F and T9600740E) to four (T9600741C) syllables each.&nbsp; However, the enquiry does not end here.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to a qualitative assessment, when considering "<i>how an average Singaporean consumer would pronounce the respective words</i>", it is likely that the Subject Mark would be referred to orally as “RED SUN” or, at the most, “RED SUN TEA SHOP”.&nbsp; This is because, as also opined above in relation to visual similarity, the most distinctive and memorable component of both the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ T9408130F is the phrase “RED SUN”.&nbsp; That is not to say the other components of the competing marks can be simply ignored.&nbsp; Rather, apprehending the marks as wholes, one must not overlook "<i>the permissibility of examining the distinctive components of the competing marks in both the technical and non-technical senses.</i>"&nbsp;

As for the Applicants' third earlier mark, T9600741C, this consists of three Japanese characters that translate into “RED SUN” in English, and the Japanese character for “sun”.&nbsp; All the Applicants' Marks contain a circle-within-a-square device, which looks like a traditional Chinese coin with square holes, but may also be perceived as a device of the sun.&nbsp;

The main concept of T9600740E may also be perceived as “red sun” to a fair proportion of the public who can read traditional Chinese script.&nbsp; The Applicants' T9600741C may still convey the concept of “red sun” seeing as the circle-within-a-square device is in the colour of the sun.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">42<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> Overall, the Subject Mark is conceptually similar to all</span> the Applicants’ Marks, but markedly more so in relation to T9408130F than to <span lang="EN-GB">T9600740E and T9600741C.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Conclusion on Similarity of Marks</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal decision in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> made clear two points, among others, when concluding whether or not two marks are similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is no "<i>particularly or notably low threshold of marks-similarity</i>", <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [16].&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal went to some length to clarify at [17]-[18] as follows:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">... The court must ultimately conclude <i>whether the marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</i>.&nbsp; The three aspects of similarity are meant to guide the court's inquiry but it is not helpful to convert this into a checkbox exercise in which a tick, however faint it might be, in any one box must compel the court to find that the marks are similar when a sensible appraisal of the marks as a whole would show otherwise.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">... In short, the criteria of visual, aural and conceptual similarities do not invite a formulaic consideration; rather, they are signposts towards answering the question of <i>whether the marks are similar</i>...</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, <i>"the assessment of marks similarity is mark-for-mark without consideration of any external matter".</i>&nbsp; The Court of Appeal elaborated at [20]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">This means that <i>at the marks similarity stage</i> this even extends to not considering the relative weight and importance of each aspect of similarity having regard to the goods.&nbsp; This does not mean that the court ignores the reality that the relative importance of each aspect of similarity might vary from case to case and will in fact depend on all the circumstances including the nature of the goods and the types of marks, as we observed at [40(b)] of <i>Hai Tong</i>.&nbsp; Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the <i>confusion</i> stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon to assess the <i>effect</i> of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers.&nbsp; We recognise that this reflects a slight departure from the approach taken by the High Court in <i>Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0552.xml&#39;)">[2010] 4 SLR 552</a></nobr> at [55]-[56], and by this court in <i>Sarika</i> at [38].</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore consider whether the respective marks, "<i>when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</i>", noting the Court of Appeal's rejection of the suggestion that "<i>any modicum of similarity would compel the court to make a finding of marks-similarity</i>" at [19] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that "<i>trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry</i>" ([18] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>), I find that the first element under Section 8(2)(b) has been satisfied having regard to the Applicants’ T9408130F, but not so in relation to T9600740E and T9600741C.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Similarity of Goods</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the element of similarity of goods under Section 8(2)(b), it is clear that the comparison is between the specification of goods claimed under the Subject Mark and the specification of goods claimed under the Applicants’ Marks and not the actual goods in use under the respective marks.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> elaborates at [46] as follows:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">We agree that the concept of similarity of goods should not be overextended or be interpreted too broadly. In <i>British Sugar</i> (at 296) it wasstated that the purpose of the words “similar goods” in s 10(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (c 26) (“UK TMA 1994”) and the Directive on which it isbased (namely the First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks)is to prevent marks from conflicting, both for their respective actual goodsand also for a penumbra. However, we need to point out that under the express terms of our s 27(2)(<i>b</i>) TMA, which is substantially similar tos 10(2) of UK TMA 1994, the comparison to be made is not between the alleged infringing goods and the actual goods of the trade mark owner but between the alleged infringing goods and <i>the products in respect of which the trade mark is registered for</i>. This is also the view of <i>Bently &amp; Sherman</i> (see above at [45]). To say that in determining similarity one should onlylook at the alleged infringing goods and the actual goods of the trade markowner and not at the specifications would be to take a view in consistent with the express terms of the provision. If that were to be the correct view,what protection is there left for the trade mark owner in respect of goodswhich are within the specifications of the registered mark, but in respect ofwhich the owner has yet to embark upon actual production? Having said that, a late entrepreneur is not without a remedy. He could apply to the Registrar of Trade Marks or to the court for revocation of the registration ofthe mark in respect of goods which the owner has yet to produce after five years of registration pursuant to s 22(1)(<i>a</i>) TMA . Alternatively, he neednot adopt a mark which is similar to the registered mark – there would thenbe nothing to impede his business venture.</span></p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy"><span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis added]</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Subject Mark is registered in respect of “Artificial coffee; beer vinegar; chocolate beverages; cocoa beverages; coffee beverages; tea-based beverages; binding agents for ice cream (edible ices); chicory (coffee substitute); chocolate; chocolate beverages containing milk; cocoa; cocoa beverages with milk; cocoa products; coffee; coffee beverages with milk; coffee flavorings (flavourings); vegetable based coffee substitutes; unroasted coffee; ice cream; edible ices; flavourings, other than essential oils, for beverages; frozen yoghurt (confectionery ices); ice for refreshment; ice, natural or artificial; iced tea; powder for making ice cream; puddings; sorbets (ices); tea” in Class 30.&nbsp; In comparison, the specification of goods claimed under the Applicants’ Marks is “Pharmaceutical preparations being health food supplements, dietetic substances adapted for medical use, herbal preparations and substances for human use, vitamins, all included in Class 5”.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the specifications of the competing marks fall under different classes.&nbsp; The Subject Mark is registered in Class 30, whilst the Applicants’ Marks are registered in Class 5.&nbsp; What inference can be drawn from this?</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier decision in <b><i>Genzyme Corporation v Novozymes Switzerland AG</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/70326-M.xml&#39;)">[2010] SGIPOS 11</a></nobr>, I had to determine whether “Enzymes for use in the brewing industry” in Class 1 were similar to “Injectable pharmaceutical preparation to treat an enzymatic deficiency caused by a genetic effect” in Class 5.&nbsp; The following observations at [40]-[43] of that earlier decision would serve us well here:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this particular factor, still, I would like to make an observation on the issue of class numbers, seeing as both parties have mentioned it in their submissions.&nbsp; Class numbers – in this case, class numbers under the Nice Classification (International Classification of Goods and Services) – facilitate the classification of goods and services in respect of which trade marks may be registered.&nbsp; The Applicants point out that the respective goods are proper to different classes – 1 and 5 in this case.&nbsp; The Opponents submit that despite different class numbers, the respective goods are similar, citing the example of the product “milk” above.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nice Classification is a tool and a useful one at that.&nbsp; It provides an internationally recognised system for the classification of goods and services in the context of trade mark applications.&nbsp; Usually, goods and services of the same or similar nature are categorised in the same class when there is a common thread running through them.&nbsp; Sometimes, unrelated goods are also found in the same class e.g. fire-extinguishing apparatus and computer programmes are both found in Class 9. &nbsp; By and large, it provides guidance during examination of trade mark applications as to the appropriate classes to search for prior, conflicting marks.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Nice Classification is only a starting point and does not purport to be authoritative in determining whether goods are similar.&nbsp; The fact that goods are categorised in the same class may indicate that they are similar in nature, but the actual inquiry has to deal with the specific goods at hand and look beyond the class number.&nbsp; Likewise, the fact that goods are not in the same class does not necessarily mean that they are not similar goods.&nbsp; That is also the point of cross-searching other potentially related classes in examination practice.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I cannot stop the line of inquiry at this point and dismiss the Opponents’ case merely because the respective goods are in different classes.&nbsp; The actual goods in issue must be weighed in the balance and it is to this exercise that we return.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the fact that the respective class numbers are different does not conclusively end the inquiry, I move on to compare the competing specifications of goods.&nbsp; In comparing goods to assess their similarity, the following factors set out by Jacob J in <b><i>British Sugar Plc v James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd</i></b> <nobr>[1996] RPC 281</nobr> (“<b><i>British Sugar</i></b>”), 296, are a good list to consider:</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective uses of the respective goods</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective users of the respective goods</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical nature of the goods</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective trade channels through which the goods reach the market;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of self-serve consumer items, where in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found in supermarkets and in particular whether there are, or likely to be found on the same or different shelves</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the respective goods are competitive.&nbsp; This inquiry may take into account how those in trade classify goods, for instance whether market research companies, who of course act for industry, put the goods or services in the same or different sectors.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of uses, the Proprietor’s specification of goods relates to general food and beverage items in the main, as well as some ingredients such as binding agents and flavourings.&nbsp; The Applicants’ specification of goods relates to pharmaceutical preparations including health food supplements, herbal preparations and vitamins.&nbsp; The latter category has a rather different use in that the purpose is to optimise the quality of life or to address health issues, beyond “bread and butter” sustenance.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective users of the competing specifications of goods may overlap, in the sense that a general member of the public who consumes food and beverages is also health-conscious and therefore stocks up on pharmaceutical preparations such as health supplements.&nbsp; However, it is fair to say that the target audience differs.&nbsp; The goods in respect of which the Subject Mark is registered are targeted at the general public, especially those members of the public who have a penchant for discretionary consumables such as coffee, tea, chocolate beverages, ice-cream, yoghurt and sorbet.&nbsp; The Applicants’ target audience, on the other hand, appears to be the health-conscious segment of the public who are willing to expend more for the sake of health.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor, the physical nature of the goods, is not particularly helpful in the instant case as the goods covered by the respective specifications are too varied and come in different physical forms.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade channels of the competing specifications of goods, however, appear to overlap.&nbsp; The goods claimed can potentially be sold through the same trade channels such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, standalone outlets or franchise stores.&nbsp; They could also possibly be sold in business-to-business channels, for example from an import company to a retail company.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the goods claimed in the competing specifications appear to be self-serve consumer items.&nbsp; However, even they could be sold through the same trade channels e.g. at a hypermarket, due to their different uses, I am persuaded that the goods claimed under the Subject Mark and those claimed under the Applicants’ Marks would be found on different shelves and possibly different sections of the store.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the extent to which the competing specifications of goods are competitive, I am more inclined to find that the respective goods are generally not substitutes and therefore not in direct competition with each other.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final point before leaving this part of the enquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Applicants have focused quite a bit on the fact that they sell green tea, which is a subset of “tea” claimed in the specification of the Subject Mark.&nbsp; However, “green tea” is properly classified under Class 30 of the Nice Classification of Goods and Services, and not under Class 5.&nbsp;

To date, Lord Macnaghten's speech in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller &amp; Co's Margarine, Limited <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/45079-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1901] AC 217</a> ("IRC v Muller &amp; Co") at 223-224 remains, in our view, the clearest exposition of what goodwill is:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has a power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The above passage highlights two essential features of goodwill. First, it is the association of a good, service or business on which the plaintiff's mark, name, labelling, etc (referred to generically as the plaintiff's "get-up") has been applied with a particular source. Second, this association is an "attractive force which brings in custom" (id at 224).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this element, I am not confined to a consideration only of earlier trade marks owned by the Applicants that are on the register of trade marks.&nbsp; In the Applicants’ High Court action for passing off (Case No. S 237/2013), they have claimed goodwill in the “RED SUN” trade mark and company name.&nbsp; Likewise, in their statement of grounds in these invalidation proceedings, the Applicants have claimed that “… the Subject Mark when used, is likely to lead to the Respondent’s goods being mistaken for our goods and/or mislead the public into thinking that the Respondent is associated with us when it is not so associated.&nbsp; As such the Subject Mark is designed to facilitate passing off, and continued registration of the Subject Mark would be contrary to Section 8(7) of the Act.”</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants’ use and promotion of their trade mark “RED SUN” in Singapore have been described at [80] to [82] above.&nbsp; I am satisfied that the Applicants enjoy goodwill in Singapore as on the application date of the Subject Mark on11 May 2010.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Misrepresentation</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second element of misrepresentation, the use of the Subject Mark in relation to the specification of goods claimed would have to lead or be likely to lead the public to believe that goods offered by the Proprietor are those of the Applicants.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is clearly a high degree of visual, aural and conceptual similarity between the words in the Applicants’ trade mark “RED SUN” and the dominant and distinctive component of the Subject Mark, namely the phrase “RED SUN”.&nbsp; The Proprietor’s website</span> <span lang="EN-GB">www.redsuntea.comrefers to the phrase “Red Sun” with high frequency, suggesting that the dominance of the phrase “RED SUN” in the Subject Mark is in fact intended.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Applicants have placed great emphasis on their tea products, such as green tea.&nbsp; In the inquiry under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act at [60] above, I have noted that “green tea” falls under Class 30 and not Class 5.&nbsp; It could not therefore aid the Applicants in a finding of goods-similarity as the Applicants’ Marks were not registered in respect of green tea.&nbsp; However, in an inquiry under passing off, this is no longer an obstacle to the Applicants.&nbsp; Based on the evidence, I accept that the Applicants’ goodwill in their trade mark “RED SUN” extends to their health supplements as well as tea products.&nbsp; As such, it is apposite to further consider the Applicants’ evidence in relation to the sale of tea in prepared and unprepared forms.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants’ evidence purports to show that it has become a common practice in Singapore for food and beverage businesses, cafés and restaurants to also sell their food and drinks in an unprepared form at their premises, under the same name and mark.&nbsp; The Applicants cite the examples of Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, The Connoisseur Concerto (TCC), Ya Kun, Cedele, Dr café coffee, Toast Box and Killiney Kopitiam.&nbsp; It is noted from the evidence that tea bags, tea leaves, coffee beans, kaya and ready-to-cook food paste, e.g. meesiam paste, are part of the merchandise of the foregoing food and beverage outlets.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, with specific reference to bubble tea outlets (the Proprietor’s local distributor operated a bubble tea shop in Toa Payoh using the name “RED SUN” and a device of a sun similar to that in the Subject Mark), the Applicants’ evidence disclosed two examples of bubble tea businesses selling tea in unprepared forms as well on the same premises.&nbsp; In particular, “Each A Cup” bubble tea outlet sold tea bags of honey red oolong tea; and “a gantea” bubble tea outlet sold various premium packed tea from Taiwan.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Applicants claim that the converse is also true.&nbsp; Namely, it is also a common practice in Singapore for businesses selling beverages in an unprepared form to expand into the food and beverage space through cafés and restaurants.&nbsp; Such businesses sell their food and drinks for immediate consumption at their premises, under the same name and mark.&nbsp; Examples cited are Old Town White Coffee, Owl, TWG, Jones the Grocer, Dean &amp; Deluca and The House of Robert Timms.&nbsp; Hence, for instance, 3-in-1 Old Town White Coffee is not only sold at supermarkets, provision stores and convenience stores, they can also be enjoyed at Old Town White Coffee café outlets in Singapore and Malaysia.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the foregoing, the Applicants’ argument that there is a connection between the retail of a food or drink item in an unprepared form, and the service of providing that food or drink in a prepared form for immediate consumption, under the same name and mark, is persuasive.&nbsp; Such a connection is especially strong in respect of coffee and tea products and offerings.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, although the Applicants have not sold their green tea in prepared forms in Singapore, unlike the Proprietor through his local distributor at the Toa Payoh bubble tea outlet, this is not fatal to a finding of misrepresentation.&nbsp; First, it is clear that both parties are in the tea business, regardless of the form of the tea (whether prepared or unprepared).&nbsp; Second, the Applicants have shown in their evidence that there is a practice in the food and beverage industry in Singapore for businesses to sell both prepared and unprepared forms of their goods under the same name and trade mark, especially in the case of tea products and offerings.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Applicants have procured the statutory declarations of four persons (described above at [5]) in support of their claim that there is misrepresentation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lim Han Chuah’s statutory declaration, he described his surprise to see the “RED SUN” bubble tea outlet located at Block 190, Lorong 6 Toa Payoh, #01-580, Singapore 310190.&nbsp; He declared that his immediate impression was that the outlet belonged to the Applicants although he knew that this could not be the case, as the Applicants’ Managing Director, Lim Han Tee, would have told him if it were so.</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next deponent, Chu Yim Ling, upon seeing the “RED SUN” bubble tea outlet in Toa Payoh, described how she turned to Lim Han Tee and asked him if the bubble tea outlet was one belonging to his company (i.e. the Applicants).&nbsp; To her surprise, Lim Han Tee told her that it did not, and that it was not in any way related to, associated with or licensed by the Applicants.</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee Siang King described, in his statutory declaration, how he came to notice the “RED SUN” outlet, which had then not yet opened, during his walk around Toa Payoh Central.&nbsp; He saw that the name “RED SUN” was the same as the name of the Applicants.&nbsp; He thought that the outlet belonged to the Applicants.&nbsp; Later on, he asked Lim Han Tee when he decided to start a retail outlet at Toa Payoh.&nbsp; To his surprise, he was told that the outlet did not belong to the Applicants and was not related in any way.</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Swee Teck described how the Proprietor’s distributor’s bubble tea outlet in Toa Payoh caught his eye because of the name “Red Sun”.&nbsp; He knew that Lim Han Tee was the Managing Director of the Applicants and that his company supplied tea under the “RED SUN” name.&nbsp; As the same name, “RED SUN”, appeared at the bubble tea outlet, he thought that it belonged to the Applicants.&nbsp; After this incident, he met Lim Han Tee and congratulated him on the opening of his tea shop in Toa Payoh, commenting that it was a good business idea for him to expand his business from the sale of tea to the retail of tea drinks.&nbsp; Tan Swee Teck was surprised and embarrassed to learn from Lim Han Tee that the bubble tea outlet did not belong to the Applicants and was not related in any way, as he had wrongly congratulated him.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account just the strong commonality of the words “RED SUN” in the Applicants’ get-up and in the Subject Mark; the goods in common, namely tea; and the common commercial practice in Singapore for businesses to sell both prepared and unprepared tea under the same name and trade mark, I would already find that the element of misrepresentation has been made out.&nbsp; This exemplifies the courts’ consistent stand that evidence of actual confusion is not necessary for a finding of misrepresentation.&nbsp; The above statutory declarations, three of which record instances of confusion first hand are relevant for consideration, however, and support a finding of misrepresentation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the point needs belabouring, that not every finding of misrepresentation is supported by evidence of actual confusion; and not every instance of actual confusion necessitates a finding of misrepresentation as the issue is one of both fact and law.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Damage</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Applicants have established goodwill and misrepresentation, what is the damage that they are likely to suffer?&nbsp; The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> recognised the restriction of expansion into another field of commercial activity which naturally extends from the original activity as a head of damage under passing off, at [108] set out below:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The restriction of expansion into another field of commercial activity which naturally extends from the original activity has been recognised by this Court as a head of damage under passing off in <i>Amanresorts</i> (at [117]). It was emphasised in <i>Amanresorts</i> (at [118]) that there needs to be a close connection between the established activity and the extended activity (<i>i.e.</i>, commercial activity which is a natural expansion of the first activity in which the claimant already has established goodwill in). We agree with the Judge’s finding that both parties’ fields of business are closely connected. The Respondent’s field of business in the present case is the sale of chocolate cream spread, while the Appellant’s field of business is food and beverage retail. Both parties are thus engaged in the business of providing consumption foodstuff and that the respective products in question include significant chocolate content.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the matters considered and analysed at [101] to [105] above, I accept that there is a close connection between the Applicants’ established activity of selling tea in an unprepared form and the extended activity of selling prepared tea that is ready for consumption there and then.&nbsp; Both the Proprietor’s and the Applicants’ fields of business are closely connected.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the element of damage is made out in relation to the Applicants’ claim for passing off.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Conclusion on Section 8(7)(a)</em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground of invalidation under Section 8(7)(a) therefore succeeds.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Ground of Invalidationunder Section 7(6)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(6) of the Act reads:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><b><span lang="EN-GB">7.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">— (6)&nbsp;A trade mark shall not be registered&nbsp;if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Decision on Section 7(6)</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading authority on bad faith in Singapore at present is <b><i>Valentino Globe BV v Pacific Rim Industries Inc</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 1203.xml&#39;)">[2010] 2 SLR 1203</a></nobr> (“<b><i>Valentino</i></b>”).&nbsp; Following the English case of <b><i>Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v Don &amp; Low Nonwovens Ltd</i></b> <nobr>[1999] RPC 367</nobr>, the Court of Appeal held at [25] that bad faith would include dealings falling short of standards of acceptable commercial behaviour by reasonable and experienced men in the particular area of trade being examined.&nbsp; Bad faith was a concept with "moral overtones", encompassing behaviour which did not involve any breach of duty, obligation or requirement that is legally binding upon the applicant: <b><i>Valentino</i></b> at [26].&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal burden of proof in this case lies with the Applicants: <b><i>Valentino</i></b> at [21].
