1. ~~remove the stop words from the soup and list of text from the classes wanted~~
2. ~~build the bag of the words~~
3. ~~create dataset and write the data set to a txt file~~
4. implement knn classifier
5. random test the results: k = 5/6, 3 labels, hoRatio = 0.1, the lowerest error rate is 0.2

TODO:

- create the dataset for the similarity classifier: naive bayes
- plot the similarity dataset
- Descision tree on similarity???
- use frequency model may not be the best because 3 different cases may has different length at the begining in general

Use knn, we could group different cases based on their classes. Like the text, image or combined logo.For a later, it will take different stratigies for a certain type case. So when seaching, it will show the cases with the same type at first and this is what the the lawyer most concerned. It will save time and manpower on just seacthing similar cases rather than working on the actual stratigies making.
