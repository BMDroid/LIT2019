Up to this point, the parties are in consensus. There is divergence, however, on what “</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">deemed to have admitted to the facts alleged by the applicant</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">” means.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants argued in favour of a very broad reading of “</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">deemed to have admitted to the facts alleged by the applicant</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">”. They claim that the Proprietor is deemed to have admitted all the elements in the grounds of invalidation relied on by the Applicants.

However, this simply means that all statements of a factual nature submitted by the Applicants in his application are not disputed.

Since this court’s decision in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, our courts have given effect to this statutory wording by applying what is now known as the “step-by-step” approach, as opposed to the competing “global appreciation approach” applied in Europe after</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1998] RPC 199</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”). Under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round. Under the global appreciation approach the elements of similarity between marks and goods or services, whilst still necessary ingredients in the confusion inquiry, are elided with other factors going towards the ultimate question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at 223–224, and</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1999] RPC 117</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”) at 132). Whilst there have been suggestions that the two approaches might be distinct without being different, we maintain this dichotomy and endorse the step-by-step approach as being conceptually neater and more systematic and, importantly, as being more aligned with the requirements imposed under our statute (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at [8]).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed under Section 8(2)(b), the Applicants have to prove three elements, namely that the competing marks are similar; the goods are identical or similar; and, because of the foregoing, there is a likelihood of confusion&nbsp;on the part of the public.I shall examine each element in turn.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Similarity of Marks: Principles</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in</span> <span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA</em></strong> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr> ("</span><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Sarika</span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">") at [16] (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14932-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 2 SLR 941</a></nobr> ("</span><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Hai Tong</span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">") at [39]) held that:</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">The decided cases have established that the court will consider three aspects of similarity,</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">viz</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">, visual, aural and conceptual similarity:</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">at [24];</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil Petroleum Co., Inc v Hyundai Mobis</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> at [17].

There is also a difference in the word “TIMES” in the Subject Mark compared to the Applicants’ "TIME" Marks.The Proprietor submits that the dominant part of the Subject Mark is the square device with the four Chinese characters. The length and structure of the marks are different and although there appears the same word “FORTUNE” in both marks, there is no similarity as the Subject Mark comprises two English words “FORTUNE TIMES” with the square device and Chinese Characters .The Proprietor highlights that the word “TIMES” in the Subject Mark is different from the word “TIME” in the Applicants’ TIME Marks, both perceived as English words alone and in context of the entire Subject Mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach to determine visual similarity described by the High Court in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Ferrero</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">above is a good starting point. The Subject Mark is significantly longer than the Applicants’ Marks, comprising four Chinese and two English words. The Applicants’ Marks are single-word marks, comprising either the word “FORTUNE” or the word “TIME”. The Subject Mark has more words than the Applicants’ Marks. As for whether the same letters are used in the marks, it is observed that the word “FORTUNE” in the Applicants’ “FORTUNE” Marks is wholly subsumed in the Subject Mark, as part of a larger whole.

The Applicants argue that “FORTUNE” and “TIME” have no relation to publications (the goods covered by the specifications of the Applicants’ Marks) and therefore enjoy high technical distinctiveness. The Applicants’ Marks appear to have been registered in Singapore without the need for evidence of use demonstrating acquired distinctiveness. Further and in any case, the Applicants claim, the Applicants’ Marks would have acquired distinctiveness as a result of long use in Singapore. I would assess this factor rather evenly between the parties. The words “FORTUNE” and “TIME”, are known English words with easily accessible meanings.Such words would be lower down on the scale of “technical distinctiveness” as compared to invented words which are highly distinctive technically, such as “NUTELLA” in the</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Sarika</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">decision.

Each of these elements can vary. The marks may be identical or similar, and if the latter, they can vary in their degree of similarity. In the same way, the goods or services in relation to which the marks are used may be identical or similar, and again, if the latter, they may vary in the degree or extent to which they are similar. ... And as to the relevant segment of the public, there may be characteristics that are particular to the group in question. Each of these factors will have a bearing on the likelihood of confusion. As an illustrative proposition, the likelihood of confusion must be greater where, say, the contesting marks are similar to a high degree, the goods are identical in nature and the segment of the public in question is undistinguished in its attention than would be the case if the marks and the goods are somewhat similar but not exceedingly so, and the relevant segment of the public happens to be highly knowledgeable and very fastidious. ...</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-10"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notional Fair Use</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">clarified the approach to determining likelihood of confusion at [60] and [62]:</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;Accordingly in opposition proceedings the inquiry must take into account the full range of the competing monopoly rights that are already enjoyed on the one hand, namely the actual and notional fair uses to which the incumbent proprietor has or might fairly put his registered trade mark, and compare this against the full range of such rights sought by the applicant by reference to any actual use by the applicant (assuming there has been prior use) as well as notional fair uses to which the applicant may put his mark should registration be granted. This is the setting in which the question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion is assessed...</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">... It would still be necessary to consider the wider question of whether the notional fair uses that the applicant might put the mark to could conflict with the notional fair uses to which the proprietor of the registered mark could put his mark to. As we have noted, this latter inquiry sets a higher threshold for the applicant than an inquiry that focuses only on whether the actual use is infringing, and it follows that as a practical matter, in opposition proceedings, the applicant will have to meet that higher threshold regardless of whether there has already been actual use. In essence, in such proceedings, he will be required to establish that the notional fair use of his mark would not infringe the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor; whereas in infringement proceedings the only question is whether the actual use by the alleged infringer infringes the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor of the mark...</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-10"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extraneous Factors</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">, the Court of Appeal also affirmed the relevance of extraneous factors "</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">to the extent they inform the court as to how the similarity of marks and goods will likely affect the consumer's perception as to the source of the goods</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">", see [83].</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific types of extraneous factors that are permissible, we have guidance from the court in the conclusion at [95]-[96] of</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">:</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the risk of origin-based confusion is the primary interest sought to be protected by trade mark law, there must be a limit to the range of external factors that may be taken into account to determine whether a sufficient likelihood of such confusion exists. The permissible factors are those which (a) are intrinsic to the very nature of the goods and/or (b) affect the impact that the similarity of marks and goods has on the consumer. The impermissible factors are those differences between the competing marks and goods which are created by a trader's differentiating steps. In other words, factors which are not inherent in the goods, but are susceptible to changes that can be made by a trader from time to time, should not be permissible considerations. In particular, we are satisfied that it is unnecessary, unworkable and impermissible for the court to have regard to such issues as pricing differentials, packaging and other superficial marketing choices which could possibly be made by the trader.

Clearly, the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion. As to the reputation of the mark,</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc v Hyundai Mobis</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr></span><span class="linkdrop-menu1"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB">("</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">") at [74] makes it clear that a strong reputation does not necessarily equate to a higher likelihood of confusion, and could in fact have the contrary effect as in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">McDonald's Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0177.xml&#39;)">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177</a> (see at [64]).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception: it would be legitimate to take into account factors concerning the very nature of the goods without implicating any steps that are taken by the trader to differentiate the goods. This includes the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type (see [20] above,</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Mystery Drinks</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [48],</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Lloyd</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">([23]</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">supra</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at 1352; and</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Phillips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">([20]</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">supra</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at [55]). This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers (see generally</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Hai Tong</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [85(c)(i)]), and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase. We refer here to</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Limited for the Registration of a Trade Mark</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">(1906) 23 RPC 774 where it was observed that, having regard to the nature of the article in question (musical instruments), the (high) price at which it was likely to be sold, and the nature of the consumers who are likely to purchase such products ("generally persons of some education"), a man of ordinary intelligence was unlikely to be confused (at 778). The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties' products. The former consideration directly impinges on the degree of care the consumer is likely to pay to his purchase and therefore his ability to detect subtle differences.

If a consumer is initially confused but this is unlikely to persist to the point of purchase because of a lack of sufficient similarity in the marks or the goods then the purpose of the trade mark as a "badge of origin" has not been undermined…</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was concluded at [116] of</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">that "</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">the doctrine of initial interest confusion should not be introduced into our law because it is inconsistent with the purpose of s 8(2) of the Act which is only to protect the trade mark as an indication of origin</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">."</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in the present case, even if there were any initial interest confusion between the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ “FORTUNE” Marks, such "confusion" would not be relevant in a determination of likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, the Applicants made an interesting submission pertaining to how a composite mark, comprising a dominant element and a less dominant but nonetheless independently distinctive, may be perceived.They refer to a European Court of Justice (ECJ) decision,</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Medion AG v Thomson Multimedia Sales Germany &amp; Austria</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">[2005] E.C.R. I-8551, [2006] IP &amp; T 150. This was a trade mark infringement case (under Article 5(1)(b),</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">in parimateria</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">with Section 27(2)(b) of the Act) where the competing marks are “LIFE” (the plaintiff’s earlier mark) and “THOMSON LIFE” (the defendant’s later mark). The ECJ’s view was that there might be a likelihood of confusion in the use of “THOMSON LIFE”, even though the overall impression produced by the combination of “THOMSON” and “LIFE” was not dominated by the earlier mark “LIFE”.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECJ opined at [29] to [35] as follows:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">29. In the context of consideration of the likelihood of confusion, assessment of the similarity between two marks means more than taking just one component of a composite trade mark and comparing it with another mark. On the contrary, the comparison must be made by examining each of the marks in question as a whole, which does not mean that the overall impression conveyed to the relevant public by a composite trade mark may not, in certain circumstances, be dominated by one or more of its components (see</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">Matratzen Concord</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">(para 32)).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30. However, beyond the usual case where the average consumer perceives a mark as a whole, and notwithstanding that the overall impression may be dominated by one or more components of a composite mark, it is quite possible that in a particular case an earlier mark used by a third party in a composite sign including the name of the company of the third party still has an independent distinctive role in the composite sign, without necessarily constituting the dominant element.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31. In such a case the overall impression produced by the composite sign may lead the public to believe that the goods or services at issue derive, at the very least, from companies which are linked economically, in which case the likelihood of confusion must be held to be established.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32. The finding that there is a likelihood of confusion should not be subject to the condition that the overall impression produced by the composite sign be dominated by the part of it which is represented by the earlier mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33.&nbsp; If such a condition were imposed, the owner of the earlier mark would be deprived of the exclusive right conferred by art 5(1) of the Directive even where the mark retained an independent distinctive role in the composite sign but that role was not dominant.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34.&nbsp; This would be the case where, for example, the owner of a widely-known mark makes use of a composite mark juxtaposing this mark and an earlier mark which is not itself widely known. It would also be the case if the composite sign was made up of the earlier mark and a widely-known commercial name.In fact, the overall impression would be, most often, dominated by the widely-known mark or commercial name included in the composite sign.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35. Thus, contrary to the intention of the Community legislator expressed in the tenth recital in the preamble to the Directive, the guarantee of the earlier mark as an indication of the origin would not be assured, even though it still had an independent distinctive role in the composite sign.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, I observed that the ECJ uses the global assessment test unlike Singapore which uses the three-step test under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act.The Applicants had the opportunity to respond, and they accordingly responded that the main point of citing the ECJ case is that the act of combining two marks, “THOMSON” and “LIFE”, is taken into account by ECJ towards a finding of confusion.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opined at [70] above, we cannot countenance the “mosaicking” of marks when applying the three-step test under Section 8(2)(b). This may be the relatively rare instance where the application of the three-step test as opposed to the global assessment test yields a different outcome. Also, and on a separate note, even as the ECJ has taken into account the less dominant but nonetheless independently distinctive element of the composite mark towards a finding of likelihood of confusion, we have likewise given due regard to all elements of the Subject Mark, and not only the dominant elements, see [37], [44] and [51] above.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-10"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factors Relating to the Impact of Goods-Similarity on Consumer Perception</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this heading, it is in order to consider "</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">factors concerning the very nature of the goods without implicating any steps that are taken by the trader to differentiate the goods. This includes the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type … whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers … and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">", see [96] of</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant goods under consideration here are the goods claimed under the Subject Mark and the Applicants' "FORTUNE" Marks. Among such goods, the Proprietor has conceded similarity or even identity ("</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">goods of the same description</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">" as the Proprietor submitted) between the goods in Class 16.Hence, the goods under scrutiny now are the goods of overlap, essentially printed publications and periodicals. The Applicants make the point that the closer the goods are to each other in nature, the higher the likelihood of confusion.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to “</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">” the goods, the Applicants further submit that printed publications and periodicals are typically placed on display in bookstores where consumers would select, browse and purchase titles without the intervention of sales personnel.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants also submit that the goods in question are relatively inexpensive. For example, they claim that the regular newsstand price of the FORTUNE magazine is S$13.50, while the TIME magazine is priced at S$9.50. At this pricing, the Applicants submit, purchasers would not naturally exercise much care in the purchase. As for the nature of the goods, the Applicants submit that periodicals are not technical products such as computers, nor personal items such as medication or cosmetics, nor high-end expensive goods such as cars. Thus, it is the Applicants’ submission that purchasers of periodicals would not pay much attention during the purchase.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for “</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">”, the Applicants submit that purchasers of periodicals would generally not apply care nor have specialist knowledge. Purchasers include businesspeople and adults who have an interest in financial matters or current affairs. A significant portion of such purchasers is likely to be those without sufficient knowledge of the Chinese language, or are foreigners living or working in Singapore.The likelihood of confusion for such purchasers is even greater, as the Subject Mark would appear to them simply as “FORTUNE TIMES”.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants submit that there is a high likelihood that the competing marks would be seen as economically linked, even when they are not.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the various factors pertaining to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception, the first factor on the degree of similarity of the goods falls in favour of the Applicants. However, the enquiry is more equivocal when the remaining factors are taken into account. Given that periodicals are typically self-serve goods available for selection and purchase off the shelf, the consumer may have opportunity to browse the contents of the periodicals before deciding whether to make the purchase. On the other hand, such opportunity may not present itself if the periodical is wrapped and sealed. If browsing is possible, a consumer could browse the periodical and, perhaps at a subconscious level, corroborate the contents with the impression given by the trade mark of the periodical to ascertain that the periodical is what he thought it was, before making the purchase. Alternatively, a consumer could browse the periodical and, without regard to the title or brand of the periodical, make a purchase simply because the contents interested him (a case of “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consideration of the impact of the price factor on consumer perception also may not clearly aid the Applicants in the current analysis. At first glance, if periodicals are contrasted with obviously more expensive goods such as cars, it could be said that the degree of attention a consumer of periodicals pays to his purchase is lower than that for a consumer of cars. Up to this point, I am prepared to agree that the factor in isolation is in the Applicants’ favour. However, this high level of abstraction may not be too helpful at a more specific level, as the impact of price on the selection and purchase of periodicals could be less straightforward than thought. While the price of periodicals in general is not high, this factor may carry less weight in the consumer’s selection and purchase of such goods. The content of the periodical would be the paramount consideration for the consumer. To this end, the prospective consumer would exercise a relatively high degree of care in selecting the reading material of interest to him and not pay less attention to what periodical he buys because the price is relatively low.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account the characteristics of consumers of periodicals, their profile is also varied. Some consumers are casual browsers who will ascertain whether the contents of a particular issue of a periodical are interesting enough before making the purchase. Other consumers are regular readers of the periodical title and will pick up every issue from the newsstand or bookstore without going through the ritual of flipping through its pages first. Yet other consumers, as regular readers, would subscribe to the periodical of their choice and expect every issue of the correct title to be delivered to them; there is no further effort in selection and purchase needed after the initial effort in ascertaining the details of their subscription such as title, period of subscription, payment mode etc. For the casual consumer who is not a regular reader of a particular title, he would generally ascertain whether the contents are of interest, either by browsing or, if the issue is wrapped, by scrutinising the cover page for an indication of the content highlights. In this process, he would have reasonable opportunity to be exposed to the trade mark associated with the periodical and chances of confusion are lower. For the regular reader who picks up every issue of a periodical title from the newsstand or bookstore, his habit would be to identify the same title each time.Such a reader is more likely than not to buy the issue that bears the name that is identical to the periodical title he is accustomed to, and will not be distracted by other titles that are suggestive of similar subject matter. Thus, the chances of confusion are also relatively low.As for the regular reader who purchases periodicals by subscription, the likelihood of confusion is even lower.At the point of subscription, such a consumer would have exercised due care and diligence in the selection of the periodical title, and mostly without the potential distraction from other titles in close proximity.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-10"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion on Likelihood of Confusion</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competing marks are only conceptually (as opposed to visually and aurally) similar, and marginally so (for the purpose of analysis under the element of “likelihood of confusion”).

To date, Lord Macnaghten's speech in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller &amp; Co's Margarine, Limited <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/45079-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1901] AC 217</a> ("IRC v Muller &amp; Co") at 223-224 remains, in our view, the clearest exposition of what goodwill is:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has a power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The above passage highlights two essential features of goodwill. First, it is the association of a good, service or business on which the plaintiff's mark, name, labelling, etc (referred to generically as the plaintiff's "get-up") has been applied with a particular source. Second, this association is an "attractive force which brings in custom" (id at 224).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the Applicants’ use and promotion of the “FORTUNE” Marks and the “TIME” Marks in Singapore, with revenue, advertising and promotion figures set out at [12] and [14] above, I am prepared to find that the Applicants enjoy goodwill in Singapore as on the application date of the Subject Mark on 3 January 2011.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Misrepresentation</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the second element of misrepresentation, I have earlier found under Section 8(2)(b) that there is no marks-similarity and also no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ Marks.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am mindful of the words of the Court of Appeal in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Hai Tong</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">at [115] that:</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">... the relevant tests for the tort of passing off and a claim for trade mark infringement are not identical, and although</span><i><span lang="EN-GB">in an action for passing off, the court is not constrained</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">in the same way that it would be in a trade mark infringement action</span> <i><span lang="EN-GB">in identifying the factors it may take into account</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">...</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(emphasis added)</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being able to consider all circumstances and not only factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity and goods-similarity on consumer perception, I now turn to the Applicants' argument, first made in relation to the element of likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b) above at [66]-[67], that it is confusing to the public that two of the Applicants' Marks, "FORTUNE" and "TIME", are found in the Subject Mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offending company name in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Fletcher</span></i></b> <span lang="EN-GB">was "Fletcher Challenge Pty Ltd" and in</span> <b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Glaxo</span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB">, it was “Glaxowellcome Limited”.

The Applicants claim that the Subject Mark was then deliberately assigned from the original proprietor Fortune Times Pte Ltd, to vest ownership in an individual based outside of Singapore.
