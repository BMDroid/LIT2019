IntelSteer Pte Ltd (<b>“the Registered Proprietors”</b>) filed their Counter-Statement on 4 February 2010. On 2 August 2012, a Pre-Hearing Review was held. Parties subsequently submitted notifications that they were not willing to mediate at that point. However, on 5 October 2012, the Registered Proprietors indicated that they wish to submit to mediation. Further, at a taxation hearing for a related matter T0903111F on 16 October 2012, parties indicated that they were negotiating both matters at the same time. Unfortunately, on 12 August 2013, the Applicants wrote in to inform that they wish to recommence the invalidation proceedings as they have not received the signed settlement agreement from the Registered Proprietors. At an ad-hoc Case Management Conference on 20 September 2013, while parties indicated that they were still trying to negotiate, the agent for the Registered Proprietors indicated that they were discharging themselves. To that end, Form TM1 was filed on 25 October 2013 which provided the Applicants’ local business address as the address for service. On 30 October 2013, the Applicants indicated again that parties were still trying to negotiate. On 16 December 2013, the Applicants informed that negotiations have broken down and that they wish to recommence the invalidation proceedings. On 19 February 2014, the Registrar wrote to the parties in relation to certain matters in light of the fact that the matter is proceeding to a full hearing. However, the letter to the Registered Proprietors was returned undelivered and Singapore Post Ltd indicated that the Registered Proprietors have moved out (in this regard, the Registered Proprietors also did not turn up for the taxation hearing for a related matter T0903111F on 20 February 2014). Since then, the Registered Proprietors have not been contactable. Correspondences sent to the address on record have been returned undelivered. On 9 June 2014, the Registrar wrote to the parties noting that the Registered Proprietors have not been contactable and indicating the Registrar’s informal understanding that it would appear that the Registered Proprietors have been gazetted to be struck off the Register of Companies on 15 August 2014. The Registrar sought an indication from the parties if they still wish to proceed with the invalidation matter in light of the above. The Applicants responded on 9 July 2014 indicating that they wish to be heard.A hearing was therefore set for 21 October 2014. The Registered Proprietors did not file any written submissions or bundle of authorities.

I note that out of 25 items, 8 items belonged to the Applicants. Out of the rest of the items, 7 items do not look remotely similar to the marks at the centre of the current contention at all.As an example, 4 of them belong to WIPO and the only reason why these marks are included in the search result is because of the word “<u>intel</u>lectual” (underlining mine) within these marks.The rest of the marks (about 6 as well) which contain "INTEL" would appear to have the word "INTEL" blended into the word mark, for example, INTELSAT which can thus be differentiated from the Registered Mark where "INTEL" stands out as a word.

The reason is that the word "INTEL" is large in comparison to the rest of the textual components, is in a prominent location (having regard to the fact that consumers will read from the left to the right) and stands out from the background of the mark as it is in bold font relative to the rest of the marks. This is in comparison to the word "Steer" which is not in bold font.I also note, and agree with the Applicants' submissions, that the word "Steer" starts with a capital "S" and thus distinguishes "Steer" from the word "INTEL". Further and importantly, based on the analysis above, I am of the view that the word "INTEL" is distinctive.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I note that although the Registered Mark appears in colour, there is no clause in the Register to the effect of the colours.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the device on the other hand is relatively simple having regard to the overall scheme of the Registered Mark. At most, I am of the view that the device appears to reinforce the slogan</span> <span lang="EN-GB">"<i>efficiency</i> in electrical energy". In this regard, I am of the view that such a concept would likely be regarded as common in relation to Class 42 services, since Class 42 in the Nice Classification, as the heading already suggests, relates to</span> <span lang="EN-GB">“<i>Scientific and technological services and research and design relating thereto; industrial analysis and research services; design and development of computer hardware and software</i>”.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">In relation to the words "efficiency in electrical energy" they appear in much smaller font and are placed at the bottom right hand corner of the Registered Mark. Therefore, in terms of placement in the overall scheme of the Registered Mark, as well as optical prominence, the slogan is much less conspicuous. Further, following the line of thought above, I am of the view that the slogan would also be common in relation to Class 42 services.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, I am of the view that the Applicants’ <b><i>INTEL Word Mark</i></b> is to <u>a low degree, visually similar</u> to that of the Registered Mark. I draw this conclusion based on an overall visual impression of the marks, bearing in mind, the distinctive and dominant component (this being the word INTEL).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said with regard to the <b><i>INTEL Stylised Mark</i></b>. I agree with the Applicants that the stylisation (the circular device) only serves to emphasize the word "INTEL" and thus heighten the similarity between the <b><i>INTEL Stylised Mark</i></b> and the Registered Mark, the Registered Mark having the word "INTEL" "boxed" within a rectangle.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Aural Similarity</font></strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to aural similarity, I note the Court in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> stated at [31] and [32] that there are two approaches. One approach is to consider the dominant component of the mark and the other is to undertake a quantitative assessment as to whether the competing marks have more syllables in common than not:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[31] At [21], [24] and [27] of the GD, the Judge considered the word “REGIS” to be the dominant and distinctive component of both marks when each is read out. <u>In our view, she was perfectly entitled to come to this view</u>. <span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span>’s argument that the Judge erred in considering the dominance of “REGIS” because the Opponents had never used or registered the component “REGIS” alone was misconceived simply because, as we have pointed above, a component can clearly be dominant even if it is part of the mark as a whole and is not and has never been used on its own. In fairness to the Judge, it should be noted that she specifically considered that the “ST.” and “Park” portions of the competing marks, though not as dominant as the “Regis” portion, were not to be ignored. <span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span>’s argument that any distinctiveness of the Opponent’s mark lay in “ST. REGIS” as a whole rather than in “REGIS” overlooked the permissibility of examining the distinctive components of the competing marks in both the technical and non-technical senses. At least in relation to hotels and hospitality services, “REGIS” enjoys a substantial degree of technical distinctiveness. In relation to both the competing marks “REGIS” is the element that is distinctive in the non-technical sense because it is what will stand out in the imperfect recollection of the consumer. The Judge was therefore entitled to find this the common dominant element of both marks in assessing the question of whether the competing marks as a whole were similar. The Judge found on this basis that the marks were aurally similar and we agree.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[32] An alternative approach which does not involve considering the dominant components of the marks would have been simply to undertake a quantitative assessment as to whether the competing marks have more syllables in common than not.

This includes the <u>normal way in or the circumstances</u> under which consumers would purchase goods of that type (see [20] above, Mystery Drinks at [48], Lloyd Schuhfabric Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 <nobr>[1999] 2 CMLR 1343</nobr> at 1352; and Philips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM <nobr>[2004] ETMR 60</nobr> at [55]). This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are <u>expensive or inexpensive items</u>, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to <u>command agreater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention</u> on the part of prospective purchasers (see generally Hai Tong at [85(c)(i)]), and the <u>likely characteristics of the relevant consumers</u> and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have <u>specialist knowledge</u> in making the purchase. We refer here to In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company for the Registration of a Trade Mark (1906) 23 RPC 774 (“Pianotist”) where it was observed that, having regard to the nature of the <u>article in question (musical instruments), the (high) price at which it was likely to be sold, and the nature of the consumers who are likely to purchase such products (“generally persons of some education”)</u>, a man of ordinary intelligence was unlikely to be confused (at 778). The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties’ products. The former consideration directly impinges on the degree of care the consumer is likely to pay to his purchase and therefore his ability to detect subtle differences. As observed in Reed Executive Plc v Reed Business Information Ltd <nobr>[2003] RPC 12</nobr> at [103], “a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of 50,000 pounds”. On the other hand, superficial price disparity between the competing goods, which speak more about the trader’s marketing choices rather than differences in the nature of the goods themselves, is not a factor we find relevant to the inquiry.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Emphasis as underlined mine].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will proceed to apply the above principles to the current case.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to mark similarity, I have already concluded above that the Applicants' Earlier Class 42 Marks are only similar to a low degree to the Registered Mark.

However, it would appear that the services, being technical in nature, would not tend to be inexpensive. Further, given the technical as well as specialist nature of the service, it would not be far fetched to imagine that the purchaser would probably need to enquire, deliberate or even seek the advice of the sales personnel before embarking on the purchase.

The revenue <u>net</u> figures span a period of <u>8 years</u> taking into account the relevant date (2002 – 2008). The revenue net figures in the Singapore context, are <u>very extensive</u>. For the revenue figures, it is clear that except for 2003 (which, incidentally, is also an impressive amount of <u>946 MILLION US Dollars</u>), for the rest of the 7 years, <u>each year</u> the Applicants managed to earn a net revenue <u>in excess of 1 BILLION US Dollars</u>.

</tbody> </table> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the sample advertisements in TODAY, the BT and the ST for products which contain an INTEL component, I note that there are a total of <u>131</u> items and spans from 1983 – 2009 ie a period of <u>26 years</u>. Taking into account the relevant date of 20 March 2009, this is still an impressive number of 25 years. However for purposes of providing the details (and thus a feel) of these advertisements, I will only take a sample of 85 items from the approximate period 2001 – 2009:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><b><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Image 10 included*]</font></b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make the following points in relation to the above evidence:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is to be noted that in categorising the marks, for convenience, I have taken the most "prominent" mark from the advertisement. By that I mean the mark that "jumps" out at the reader.It is natural for the word "INTEL" to be included in the advertisement since it is expected that the advertisements, which promote computers containing the Applicants' microprocessor, would necessarily need to describe the fact that the computer contains the microprocessor and the necessary details of the microprocessor. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the “main” mark of the Applicants which has been reflected in the table above, it is to be noted that the word INTEL is included in most, if not all, of these advertisements.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to make is that it is noted that the <b><i>Applicants' Earlier Marks</i></b> used above are variants of the Applicants' <b><i>INTEL Word Mark</i></b> as well as the <b><i>INTEL Stylised Mark</i></b>. However, I am of the view that given particular distinctiveness (both inherent and acquired) of the word INTEL, it is the word "INTEL" that stands out for the different variants. The evidence in relation to this issue has been discussed above.I make the observation that where the variants include the <b><i>INTEL Word Mark</i></b> or the <b><i>INTEL Stylised Mark</i></b>, the <b><i>INTEL Word Mark</i></b> or the <b><i>INTEL Stylised Mark</i></b> usually makes up approximately 40% to 50% of the mark. Finally, I add that “centrino” is a platform that includes the microprocessor itself while “core” refers to the microprocessor itself.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that I wish to make is that all the above relate to the item/good "microprocessor".</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, these publications are the <u>main stream local media</u>. It is noted that the majority of the above promotions are in TODAY which, as at today, is one of the more popular news publications, given that it provides bite size news which is more palatable to the general reader.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now consider news reports about the Applicants. It is noted that there are a total of 59 such articles from <u>1985 – 2008</u> taking into account the relevant date <u>(ie 24 years)</u>. However, for purposes of providing the details (and thus a feel) of these advertisements, I will only take a sample of 35 items from the approximate period of 1991 – 2007:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><b><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Image 11 included*]</font></b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make the following points in relation to the evidence above:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to the Applicants is in relation to them as a company rather than a reference to the Applicants' marks in general.

The English Court of Appeal in Whirlpool Corporation &amp; Ors v Kenwood Ltd <nobr>[2010] RPC 2</nobr> (“Whirlpool”) at [113] disagreed with counsel’s contention that “where the third party, using a sign which is sufficiently similar to a mark with a reputation for a link to be established, obtains any commercial boost or other advantage from the link, then that advantage is of itself unfair, without proof of any additional factor”. <u>The Court of Appeal opined that such a reading would equate any advantage with an unfair advantage, and would effectively deprive the word “unfair” of any added meaning (Whirlpool at [114]-[115])</u>. On the facts of Whirlpool itself, the court held that it was not sufficient for the proprietor to show that the alleged infringer had obtained an advantage; there must be an “added factor of some kind for that advantage to be categorised as unfair” (Whirlpool at [136]).</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[182] The question of unfair advantage has to be considered using a global assessment (Intel at [79], Whirlpool at [137]). On a reading of the decisions of Intel, L’Oreal and Whirlpool, it is evident that there are <u>several factors</u> to consider in determining whether an unfair advantage had been taken. <u>It is trite that none of the factors are determinative, and in the final analysis, it must be shown that the alleged infringer had drawn some unfair advantage from the use of the similar sign</u> (Whirlpool at [137]). Each of these factors will be discussed in the context of the present factual circumstances.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[183] <u>The first factor to consider is the strength of the mark’s reputation and the degree of distinctive character of the mark</u> (Intel at [65], L’Oreal at [44] and Whirlpool at [137]). With regard to this factor, I had earlier found that the “Nutella” mark is distinctive (see [74] above). I would also note that the evidence of the Plaintiff’s survey, the Internet blogs and the newspaper articles (all referred to in [155]) suggest that the “Nutella” mark had a strong reputation.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[184] <u>The second factor is the degree of similarity between the marks at issue</u> (L’Oreal at [44], Whirlpool at [137]).

On the facts of Whirlpool, the English Court of Appeal found that the alleged infringer had no need to ride on the proprietor’s coat-tails, and that despite the goods being “very similar (even identical…)” (emphasis added) and the mark being “distinctive, but not strongly so”, there was insufficient proof that the association of the earlier mark would enhance the performance of the later sign (Whirlpool at [138]).

It is not difficult to envisage that the Applicants, who are engaged in the business of manufacturing microprocessors / computers, could expand into the area of energy efficiency. From the evidence it is clear that the Applicants, whilst they are primarily known for microprocessors / computers, are also actively engaged in a wide range of goods / services.In addition to the list at [11] of <b><i>George’s Evidence</i></b>, examples abound in exhibit C (pages 63 and 64) of the same evidence.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I refer to <b><i>George’s Evidence</i></b> at exhibit A which provides the areas of research and development which the Registered Proprietors are involved in in the United States.I note that one of the areas of research under Intel Labs is “Sustainability”.

In essence, the point is that in the competitive consumer market, if there was anything that the consumers will take notice of at all, the one thing that they would notice would be the price that they pay for the product. I agree, and thus the conclusion which has been drawn in relation to the ground of objection under Section 8(2)(b). However, in relation to this limb under this ground, I am of the view that this issue does not have much impact as the goods / services for the purposes of comparison under this instance are not competitive.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Relevant public and their nature</font></strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the relevant public of the Applicants' goods, in this case, microprocessors / computers, would be specialists in the relevant industries.

However, I have already noted that while price is a factor which is usually taken into account, in this instance where the goods / services are not competitive, price may not be something which is featured as highly as in the instance of competitive goods / services. The services are likely to be purchased by in-house personnel and not by the man on the street.

There are already reports in the local media of tie-ups between the Applicants and local companies / companies which are locally based / companies having a local presence. See, for example, above at item 10 "<i>Creative Tech enters into strategic tie-up with Intel</i>" or item 31 "<i>1,500 electronic jobs; Intel and Micron to build a multi-billion flash chip plant here</i>" (more examples are italicised in the table above). Having already delved into the area of energy efficiency in the United States, it would not be surprising if the Applicants enter into some form of partnership / joint venture with another local company / locally based company / company having a local presence in the area of energy efficiency in the local context.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I note that page 3976 of <b><i>Zefo's Evidence</i></b> is an article from the BT dated 13 January 2000 and titled “<i>Intel invest in Singapore e-commerce provider bex.com</i>”:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Last year, Intel invested in about 25 companies in six Asia-Pacific countries…</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">To-date, Intel has invested US$4.8 billion in over 300 technology companies worldwide, making it one of the biggest technology investors.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mindful of the fact that these services are technical / scientific services and would be purchased by personnel within the industries, in contrast to the man on the street.
