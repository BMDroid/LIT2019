Under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. <u>The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round</u>…</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[16] However we do <u>not</u> agree with the Opponents’ approach to the extent that it suggests that any particularly or notably low threshold of marks-similarity applies…</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[17] More fundamentally, the minimal threshold approach is inconsistent with the reality that the similarity of marks is ultimately and inevitably a matter of <u>impression</u> rather than one that can be resolved as a quantitative or mechanistic exercise (see Polo (CA) at [35] and Wagamama Ltd v City Centre Restaurants Plc <nobr>[1995] FSR 713</nobr> at 732)…<u>The court must ultimately conclude whether the marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</u>. The three aspects of similarity are meant to <u>guide</u> the court’s inquiry but it is not helpful to convert this into a checkbox exercise in which a tick, however faint it might be, in any one box must compel the court to find that the marks are similar when a sensible appraisal of the marks as a whole would show otherwise.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[18] We observed this in Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0026.xml&#39;)">[2013] SGCA 26</a></nobr> (“Hai Tong”) at [40(a)]. <u>Congruously, there is no prescribed requirement that all three aspects of similarity must be made out before the marks can be found to be similar</u>: MediaCorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0496.xml&#39;)">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496</a> (“MediaCorp”) at [32] and Sarika Connoisseur Café Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr> (“Sarika”) at [16]. In short, the criteria of visual, aural and conceptual similarities do not invite a formulaic consideration; rather, they are <u>signposts</u> towards answering the question of whether the marks are similar. <u>Trade-offs</u> can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry: Ozone Community Corp v Advance Magazine Publishers Inc <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 0459.xml&#39;)">[2010] 2 SLR 459</a></nobr> (“Ozone”), see also Bently and Sherman, Intellectual Property Law (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2009) ("Bently&amp; Sherman") at p 864.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[19]…A productive and appropriate application of the step-by-step approach necessitates that the court reach a <u>meaningful conclusion at each stage</u> of the inquiry…</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[20] Finally, on this issue, we reiterate that the assessment of marks similarity is <u>mark-for-mark without consideration of any external matter</u>: see Mediacorpat [33], Sarikaat [17] and Hai Tong at [40(b)]. <u>This means that at the marks similarity stage this even extends to not considering the relative weight and importance of each aspect of similarity having regard to the goods</u>. This does not mean that the court ignores the reality that the relative importance of each aspect of similarity might vary from case to case and will in fact depend on all the circumstances including the nature of the goods and the types of marks, as we observed at [40(b)] of Hai Tong. <u>Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the confusion stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon to assess the effect of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers</u>. We recognise that this reflects a slight departure from the approach taken by the High Court in Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co Ltd <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0552.xml&#39;)">[2010] 4 SLR 552</a></nobr> at [55]–[56], and by this court in Sarikaat [38].

a "Play" device and the slogan "Activate Fresh Flavour" (this slogan, which is not readily perceptible from the above reproduction of&nbsp; the mark, appears in small font below "L&amp;M").&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the mark T1101910A comprises "Activate", "2-in-1" and a "Play" device.&nbsp; On the other hand, the <b><i>Opponents' Mark</i></b> is simply a word only mark

lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the <b><i>Applicants' SD</i></b> at [17].&nbsp; The Applicants deposed that most tobacco traders are currently offering cigarettes with flavoured capsules in their filters, which will allow an adult smoker to switch from one taste to another by providing them with the option of crushing/activating the capsule to release the flavour, usually menthol, inside ("<b><i>Capsule Devices</i></b>").&nbsp; The Applicants further deposed that cigarettes which incorporate the <b><i>Capsule Devices</i></b> are sold by various tobacco companies, including the Applicants and the Opponents.</font></span></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman,

containing such flavoured <b><i>Capsule Devices</i></b>.&nbsp; In fact, it is for this reason that the <b><i>Application Marks</i></b> incorporate the word "activate" in various forms.</font></span></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, the Applicants thus deposed (see the <b><i>Applicants' SD</i></b> at [18]) that the word "activate" thus bears descriptive reference to tobacco goods and could be perceived as descriptive of their characteristics or purposes, particularly tobacco goods containing such <b><i>Capsule Devices</i></b>.&nbsp; At this juncture, I refer in particular to Exhibit G of the <b><i>Applicants' SD.&nbsp;</i></b> The Applicants deposed that this provides examples of such descriptive use.</font></span></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman,

follows.</font></span></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the examples of use of the term "activate" in relation to the different variants of the <b><i>Opponents' Mark</i></b> in other countries, I am of the view that these are not helpful given that the situation in the local context is different (I note that the examples in Exhibit G are undated; however, it is possible to have an approximate gauge of the date by reference to the <b><i>Opponents' 1<sup>st</sup> SD</i></b> at [13] which provides the launch dates of the different variants of the <b><i>Opponents' Mark</i></b> in the different countries).&nbsp; By that I mean that the restrictions imposed by law in relation to promotion and sale of the tobacco industry vary from country to country.&nbsp; Specifically, in Singapore,</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB">virtually all advertising of tobacco products is banned.</span><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB">So for example, at pages 397 – 399 (for The Netherlands) which show advertisement posters that provide step by step instructions as to how to "operate" an <i>Activate Freshness</i> / <i>Camel Activate</i> cigarette (see <b><i>Opponents' 1<sup>st</sup> SD</i></b> at [12]), as well as the general instructions "<i>Press the filter to activate freshness</i>", it has not been shown if such a poster will be allowed in the local context.</span></span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times

<i>Activate Freshness</i> / <i>Camel Activate</i> cigarette.&nbsp; Again it has not been shown if such a poster will be allowed in the local context.&nbsp; The same argument applies to pages 401 – 402 (for Switzerland).&nbsp; They show, respectively, an advertisement poster, with the words "<i>Your Choice Press to Activate</i>" ie instructions as to how to "operate" an <i>Activate Freshness / Camel Activate</i> cigarette as well.&nbsp; Again, it is unclear if such an advertisement will be allowed in the local context.</font></span></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span class="definition"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what <i>can</i> be culled from the above evidence which is of relevance to the local context is that the word

This includes the <u>normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type</u> (see [20] above, Mystery Drinks at [48], Lloyd Schuhfabric Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 <nobr>[1999] 2 CMLR 1343</nobr> at 1352; and Philips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM <nobr>[2004] ETMR 60</nobr> at [55]). This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are <u>expensive or inexpensive items</u>, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to <u>command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention</u> on the part of prospective purchasers (see generally Hai Tong at [85(c)(i)]), and the <u>likely characteristics of the relevant consumers</u> and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have <u>specialist knowledge</u> in making the purchase. We refer here to In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company for the Registration of a Trade Mark (1906) 23 RPC 774 (“Pianotist”) where it was observed that, having regard to the nature of the <u>article in question (musical instruments), the (high) price at which it was likely to be sold, and the nature of the consumers who are likely to purchase such products (“generally persons of some education”)</u>, a man of ordinary intelligence was unlikely to be confused (at 778). The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties’ products. The former consideration directly impinges on the degree of care the consumer is likely to pay to his purchase and therefore his ability to detect subtle differences. As observed in Reed Executive Plc v Reed Business Information Ltd <nobr>[2003] RPC 12</nobr> at [103], “a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of 50,000 pounds”. On the other hand, superficial price disparity between the competing goods, which speak more about the trader’s marketing choices rather than differences in the nature of the goods themselves, is not a factor we find relevant to the inquiry.</font></span></i></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Emphasis as underlined mine].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">T1101909H</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity on consumer perception, if the marks are similar, they can at most be considered to be <i>marginally</i> similar.&nbsp;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">The impression given by the marks differs.&nbsp;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">The mark applied for gives an overall impression that it is one of the family of marks under "L&amp;M".&nbsp;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">Importantly, in relation to the reputation of the Applicants, following the Court in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [96a], I am of the view that the Applicants' reputation in the current case is likely to have an effect <i>contrary</i> to a likelihood of confusion, as the Applicants' "L &amp; M" brand would be sufficiently entrenched in the mind of consumers as to dispel any real possibility of confusion with the <b><i>Opponents' Mark</i></b>.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">83&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception, it is important to note that, first and foremost, the sale of tobacco products is regulated by law in Singapore.&nbsp; As a result, the relevant consumers in this case, due to statutory restrictions on the sale of tobacco in Singapore, are adults who are above 18 years of age ie, the relevant consumers are all adults.&nbsp; Importantly, I agree with the Applicants that it is a common characteristic of smokers that they recognise and purchase their preferred product by brand and they tend to stick to their preferred brand.&nbsp; Further, the sale of tobacco products are regulated such that tobacco products are displayed in retail outlets in a way that consumers will require the assistance of an employee of the retailer to obtain the items, usually from a display case behind the counter.&nbsp; Thus, the consumer would have to approach a staff to request for a particular brand of cigarettes or point to the brand which he wishes to purchase.&nbsp; In this regard, the visual and aural aspects of the marks are more important.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave this element, I am of the view that the above will apply, as appropriate, to smokers’ articles.
