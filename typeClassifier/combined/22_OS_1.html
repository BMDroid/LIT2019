I will set out the salient points of this history below, for the record.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Applicants filed and served the present application on 26 May 2011. On 8 July 2011, the Registered Proprietors sought an extension of time to file their Counter-Statement ("<b>CS</b>"), noting that the due date for the filing of the CS was 26 July 2011.&nbsp; On 22 July 2011, the Principal Assistant Registrar ("<b>PAR</b>") granted the Registered Proprietors an extension of time up till 26 September 2011 to file their CS. However, no CS was filed by this date. On 31 October 2011, the Registrar requested for the parties to attend a Case Management Conference ("<b>CMC</b>"). At the CMC, the Applicants questioned why the Registered Proprietors should be allowed to participate in the proceedings as no CS had been filed. The PAR pointed to Rule 58 of the Trade Marks Rules (Rev. Ed. 2008) (the "<b>Rules</b>"), which did not bar them from continuing to participate in the IPOS proceedings.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Applicants asked the PAR to reconsider her decision, and eventually applied for an interlocutory hearing in this regard. Both parties submitted written submissions and authorities. However, on 17 February 2012, the Applicants' application was refused and the directions given at the CMC were to stand. The Applicants filed an Originating Summons ("<b>OS</b>") to the High Court on 14 March 2012, requesting for the orders given by the PAR to be set aside in their entirety and for the application for declaration of invalidity to be granted. However, the Applicants later withdrew this OS pursuant to directions by the High Court judge.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invalidation proceedings at IPOS resumed and the Applicants filed and served their evidence in support of the invalidation proceedings on 3 August 2012. According to the applicable Rules, the Registered Proprietors were to file their evidence by 3 October 2012. The Registered Proprietors did not file evidence by the deadline. On 12 October 2012, the PAR wrote to both parties informing them that the Registered Proprietors are deemed to admit to the facts alleged by the Applicants, per Rule 33(3) read with Rule 59(2)(d) of the Rules.&nbsp; The Registered Proprietors then wrote to the PAR on the same day to request for an extension of time for 2 months, as they were under the impression that the timelines given at the CMC were applicable, not those in the statute. This led to an interlocutory hearing on the issue of whether the Registered Proprietors should be granted an extension of time beyond the statutory deadline. The hearing was scheduled for 19 December 2012.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 3 December 2012, the Registered Proprietor sent a document titled "Statement of Issues" to IPOS and the Applicants. However, on 10 December 2012, the PAR wrote to both parties informing them that this document was irrelevant to the interlocutory hearing, as it was not filed pursuant to the issue at stake.&nbsp; The interlocutory hearing proceeded on 19 December 2012. The PAR directed the Applicants to consider if they wished to consent to the Registered Proprietors' request for an extension of time and whether or not to continue with negotiations in the hope of settlement. The Applicants did not consent and the Registered Proprietors were deemed to admit to the facts alleged by the Applicants under Rule 33(3) and Rule 59(2)(d) of the Rules.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between January 2013 to October 2013, the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations. However, on 10 October 2013, the Applicants wrote to inform the PAR that the parties were unable to arrive at a settlement, and for a hearing date to be given. A Pre-Hearing Review ("<b>PHR</b>") was fixed on 30 October 2013.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the PHR, the Registered Proprietors indicated, for the first time in the invalidation proceedings, that they wished to cross-examine the Applicants' deponent, Mr Yee Kok Chew, during the hearing of the matter. The Assistant Registrar ("<b>AR</b>") gave the Registered Proprietors leave to file an application for such cross-examination. An interlocutory hearing was fixed for 4 February 2014.&nbsp; After considering parties' oral and written submissions, the AR allowed the Registered Proprietors' application for cross-examination in part. Cross-examination was limited to paragraphs [21]-[26] of the Applicants' SD.&nbsp; The full decision for this interlocutory hearing is reported as <b><i>Application for Cross-Examination by PT Eigerindo Multi Produk Industri and Objection Thereto by Sports Connection Pte Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85723-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b> ("<b><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85723-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b>").</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AR wrote to parties on 18 July 2014 to indicate that the matter was ready for hearing.&nbsp; The Applicants wrote back to indicate their available dates for a hearing. The agents for the Registered Proprietors, on the other hand, wrote to inform the AR that they wished to discharge themselves from acting further in the proceedings, in a letter dated 24 July 2014. The AR replied on 5 August 2014 to inform the agents for the Registered Proprietors that they would have to file a Form TM 1 (under the Rules) to request for a change of address of service, failing which she would proceed to fix a date for hearing.&nbsp; As no Form TM 1 was filed, the agents for the Registered Proprietors remained on record, and the matter was fixed for a hearing on 25 November 2014, with written submissions due on 27 October 2014. The agents for the Registered Proprietors wrote to the AR on the same day (4 September 2014), informing that they had forwarded the Form TM 1 to their clients for them to file, and that they could not do the same on behalf of their clients because their clients did not have a Singapore address. Nevertheless, they took the position that they "have discharged [themselves] from acting for [the Registered Proprietors]." The AR wrote on 10 September 2014, informing the agents for the Registered Proprietors that they were still on record for the purposes of all proceedings in respect of T0812097B, as long as no Form TM 1 was filed, and asked the agents for the Registered Proprietors if they were going to attend the hearing (given that they had obtained leave for cross-examination of the Applicants' deponent). On 12 September 2014, the agents for the Registered Proprietors said that they would not be attending the hearing on 25 November 2014.&nbsp; The hearing therefore proceeded on a <i>de facto ex-parte</i> basis.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Preliminary Issue</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Applicants submit that, as a preliminary issue, the Registered Proprietors are deemed to have admitted to the facts alleged by the Applicants in their application in accordance with Rule 33(3) read with Rule 59(2)(d) of the Rules, despite the&nbsp; outcome in <b><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85723-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b> (see paragraph [13] above).&nbsp; The Applicants highlighted that, in <b><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85723-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b>, I had gone on to state that "a strict application of Rule 33(3) read with Rule 59(2)(d) is warranted where there is complete silence by the defaulting party, as in the case of <b><i>Morton's</i></b> (referring to <b><i>Morton's of Chicago Inc v Lone Star Restaurants Limited</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/72025-M.xml&#39;)">[2011] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b>)."&nbsp; The Applicants submitted that the current situation amounted to "more than complete silence" and that a strict application of Rule 33(3) read with Rule 59(2)(d) was therefore warranted (see Applicants' Written Submissions at [30]-[31]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Decision on Preliminary Issue</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application of Rule 33(3) and Rule 59(2)(d) in relation to the present proceedings was substantively discussed in the context of <b><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85723-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 2</a></nobr></b>.

The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> elaborated further at [40] on other general principles in this assessment:</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of the inquiry into similarity is directed at assessing substantive similarity. The three aspects of this evaluation, namely, visual, aural and conceptual similarities, aid the court's evaluation by signposting its inquiry. They do not serve as a mechanistic formula of any sort. It follows that the law does not require all three similarities…to be made out before the registered mark and the allegedly infringing mark may be found to be similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the similarity between two competing marks, the court considers them "as a whole" (see <i>City Chain</i> at [47] and [50]), but does not take into account "any external added matter or circumstances" because the comparison is "mark for mark"…</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the focus of this part of the inquiry is on the marks in question, it is necessary to set out the viewpoint that the court should assume. This viewpoint is that of the average consumer who would exercise some care and a measure of good sense in making his or her purchases, not that of an unthinking person in a hurry…</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is assumed that the average consumer has "imperfect recollection" (see <i>MediaCorp</i> at [33], citing <i>Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard and another</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071.xml&#39;)">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071</a> ("<i>Nautical Concept</i>") at [30]). As such, the two contesting marks are not to be compared or assessed side by side and examined in detail for the sake of isolating particular points of difference. Instead, the court will consider the general impression that will likely be left by the essential or dominant features of the marks on the average consumer…</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular,&nbsp; the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [20] affirmed <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> at [40(b)] and held that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">…the assessment of marks similarity is mark-for-mark, without consideration of any external matter: see <i>MediaCorp</i> at [33], <i>Sarika</i> at [17] and <i>Hai Tong</i> at [40(b)]. <b>This means that at the marks similarity stage this even extends to not considering the relative importance of each aspect of similarity having regard to the goods.</b> This does not mean that the court ignores the reality that the relative importance of each aspect of similarity might vary from case to case and will in fact depend on all the circumstances including the nature of the goods and the type of marks, as we observed in <i>Hai Tong</i> at [40(b)]. <b>Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the <i>confusion</i> stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon to assess the <i>effect</i> of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers.</b>&nbsp; We recognise that this reflects a slight departure from the approach taken by the High Court in <i>Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0552.xml&#39;)">[2010] 4 SLR 552</a></nobr> at [55]-[56], and by this court in <i>Sarika</i> at [38].

In this particular case, we consider whether the textual component of the composite mark can be the dominant component of the mark. With regard to this particular issue, the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> held at [62(d)] that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textual component of a composite mark or sign could (but will not necessarily or always) be the dominant component of the mark or sign.

Then, it should be noted that the words "della", "costiera" and "amalfitana" are placed beneath the word "limoncello" and are written in much smaller yellow letters and, therefore, are clearly secondary in relation to the word "limoncello". As regards the word "shaker", it is only just visible in the mark taken as a whole, as it is located at the bottom of the mark and is written in little blue letters in a frame with a white background. The image of the glass in the letter "k" goes almost unnoticed. The component "shaker" is thus negligible in the overall impression created by the trade mark applied for.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it should be recalled that consumers of the goods in question usually describe and recognise the goods in question by reference to the verbal elements which identifies them…Inasmuch as the figurative component of the trade mark applied for consists solely of a round plate decorated with lemons, that component does not attract the attention of the average consumers of the goods in question, who are regularly confronted with images of lemons affixed to lemon-based liqueurs. The word which the relevant public will remember is, rather, the word "limoncello", in view of its prominent location and its position in relation to the other components, the fact that it is written in large white letters on a blue background, and its size as compared with all the other word components of that composite mark. Thus, Shaker's claim is that although the round plate decorated with lemons constitutes a decorative component, it is much more likely than the word component to distinguish the goods described, and to capture the attention of the relevant consumer, cannot be accepted.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the Court of Appeal's latest decision in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b>, the "extraneous factors" considered in <b><i>Shaker (CFI)</i></b> at [42] – ie. the manner in which the consumers of the goods "<i>usually describe and recognise the goods in question by reference to the verbal elements which identifies them</i>" and "<i>who are regularly confronted with images of lemons affixed to lemon-based liqueurs</i>" – cannot be taken into consideration at the marks similarity stage of assessment.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I agree that the word component in each of the competing marks is the dominant element of these marks. The textual component is given some prominence in each mark, the Applicants' Mark being in a centralized position, in a bold font that allows the text to stand out against the comparatively faint lines of the background device. In the Registered Mark, the textual component "BODYPACK" is the centrepiece of the mark, with a smaller device flanking its left hand side, and a much smaller sub-line of text "digital case" underneath the main textual component, indicating that it is less important. Furthermore, both devices in the Applicants' Mark and the Registered Mark are simple geometric shapes or decorative elements that do not evoke any particular meaning for the consumer. I find the cases of <b><i>Yakult Honsha Kabushiki Kaisha</i> (Case T-276/09) <nobr>[2012] ETMR 45</nobr></b> ("<b><i>Yakult</i></b>") and <b><i>Trubion Pharmaceuticals, Inc v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market&nbsp; (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM)</i> (Case T-412/08) [2009] ECR II-239&nbsp;</b> ("<b><i>Trubion</i></b>") instructive on this point.&nbsp; These cases were cited and discussed by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> at [56], [57], [62], in formulating the general principles applicable to the analysis of a dominant component within composite marks.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Yakult</i></b>, the relevant mark was</span> <b>[Image 5]</b><span lang="EN-GB">, registered in Class 29 and Class 32. The General Court held at [46]-[47] that</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the graphic element of the earlier figurative mark, the only element capable of being distinctive consists of shapes similar to brackets which merely surround the word element “yakult”. That element cannot be regarded as the dominant element in the overall impression produced by the sign Yakult. <b>It is a sort of outline, in oval form, that is to say, a simple geometric form which will not evoke any particular concept for the average consumer.</b></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, as the Board of Appeal noted in para.23 of the contested decision, the Court has already held that <b>an oval outline is clearly of secondary and accessory importance</b> in comparison with the central element that it surrounds (see Saint-Gobain Pam SA v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) – Propamsa (PAM PLUVAL) (T-364/05) [2007] E.C.R. II-757 at [98]). (Emphasis added)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Trubion</i></b> (also cited by the Applicants), the relevant mark was</span> <b>[Image 6]</b><span lang="EN-GB">. The General Court held, at [44], that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">As regards the figurative element, although it is larger than the word element of the earlier mark, <b>it is not arranged in a specific, original or elaborate manner, in such a way that it might significantly influence the overall impression produced by the earlier sign.</b> Moreover, as OHIM rightly states, that figurative element <b>has no clear semantic content</b> on its own. (Emphasis added)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the device component in the Registered Mark is that of a simple and relatively common geometric shape (a diamond shape) and is "clearly of secondary and accessory importance" to the word "BODYPACK". Furthermore, it is not particularly evocative of any particular concept and does not "significantly influence the overall impression of the design."&nbsp; The words "digital case" are clearly subordinate to the word "BODYPACK", as they are written in much smaller font and placed physically below the much larger textual component "BODYPACK."&nbsp; The Applicants' Mark, on the other hand, also employs a simple device of an "indented rectangle" (as it is described by the Applicants in their written submissions at [43]) which, although not as generic as the device of the diamond shape, does not have any clear semantic content on its own and appears to be an abstract, decorative shape that forms the background to the word "BODYPAC."</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that I have found that the dominant components of the competing marks are "BODYPACK" and "BODYPAC" respectively, I find that they are visually similar. In <b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [23] the Court of Appeal compared the length of the competing marks/signs (the "Nutello" sign and the "Nutella" word mark), the structure of the sign and the mark and the letters in each word, finding that they were essentially the same, save for the last letter. The court then applied the principle of "imperfect recollection" and held that "it would not be difficult to conclude" that the "Nutello" sign and the "Nutella" mark are visually similar given the difference of only one letter. Importantly as well, the court also held that "regardless of the font, typeface or design of the "Nutello" sign used by the Appellant…the mark and sign are still similar" (<b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [24]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the principle of imperfect recollection of the consumer, that "comparisons are usually made from memory, removed in time and space from the actual marks in question" (<b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [18]), and that the competing marks are not to be compared or assessed side by side and examined in detail for the sake of isolating particular points of difference (<b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> at [40] cited above at paragraph [24]), I find that the general impression that would be likely left in the mind of the consumer is that the competing marks are visually similar.&nbsp; The letters in "<b><u>BODYPAC</u></b>" and "<b><u>BODYPAC</u></b>K" share the same letters (as indicated in bold and underlined) except for the last letter, "K". Given the difference of only the final letter, and the fact that the final letter does not add any particular visual significance to the dominant component, I find that the average consumer is likely to find that the competing marks are visually similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Aural Similarity</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the IPOS decision of <b><i>Fox Street Wear Pte Ltd v Fox Racing, Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/87993-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 13</a></nobr></b> (“<b><i>Fox</i></b>”), the Principal Assistant Registrar ("<b>PAR</b>") noted that the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> alluded to two approaches for assessing aural similarity: (1) ascertain the "common dominant element" of both marks and (2) undertake a "quantitative assessment as to whether the competing marks have more syllables in common than not" (see <b><i>Fox</i></b>, at [68], citing <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [31]-[33]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed in <b><i>Fox</i></b> that the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> appeared to endorse the High Court's approach in considering the dominance of the word "Regis" in the competing trade mark "St Regis" and application mark “</span><b>[Image 7]”</b><span lang="EN-GB">. The Court of Appeal continued to find that "there is a high degree of aural similarity between the competing marks because of the distinctiveness of the common "Regis" component in both the technical and non-technical senses" (<b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [33]). In <b><i>Fox</i></b> at [70], the PAR suggested that the proper approach to take would depend on the facts of each individual case, and in the current situation, it was how the average consumer would pronounce these marks that mattered to the comparison. The PAR considered how the opponents' marks, <i>inter alia</i>, “</span><b>[Image 8]”</b> <span lang="EN-GB">and the application mark “</span><b>[Image 9]”</b> <span lang="EN-GB">would be perceived by the average consumer and held that they would both likely be pronounced as "FOX". The words "What's Stopping You?" and "Fox Street Wear" in the application mark were not taken into account.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the recent High Court decision in <b><i>Han's (F&amp;B) Pte Ltd v Gusttimo World Pte Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/16950-SSP.xml&#39;)">[2015] SGHC 39</a></nobr></b> ("<b>Han's</b>"), the court considered the perspective of the average consumer and the doctrine of imperfect recollection in deciding aural similarity of the "HAN sign" “</span><b>[Image 10]</b><span lang="EN-GB">” and Han's trade marks “</span><b>[Image 11]</b><span lang="EN-GB">”. In particular, at paragraph [137] the High Court held:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">In my view, there is phonetic similarity between the HAN sign and the Han’s trade marks. <b>The main phonetic component of the HAN sign is “HAN”. “Cuisine of Naniwa” is subsidiary. It is doubtful that the average consumer would make constant reference to the seven-syllable “HAN Cuisine of Naniwa” phrase every time he refers to it.</b> “HAN” and “Han’s” are both single-syllable words which share similar pronunciations. Adequate allowance must be made for imperfect recollection and careless pronunciation and speech: <i>Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v McDonald’s Corp</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0629.xml&#39;)">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 629</a> at [12]. The slightest mispronunciation would result in complete identity. There is, therefore, phonetic similarity between the HAN sign and the Han’s trade marks. (Emphasis added)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following from these cases, I consider how the average consumer would pronounce or recall the Registered Mark in his imperfect recollection. The Registered Mark comprises of the word "Bodypack" and "digital case", where the latter appears in much smaller font and in a position subordinate to the former.&nbsp; As such, I find that the average consumer is likely to pronounce or recall only the dominant component of the Registered Mark, which is "Bodypack".&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the dominant word components of the competing marks have 3 syllables, all of which sound alike (ie. "BO"-"DY" -"PACK" / "BO"-"DY" -"PAC"). I accept the Applicants' submission that the letter "K" contained in the Registered Mark</span> <span lang="EN-SG">does not make any discernible aural difference to its pronunciation because it produces the same sound as the letter "C".&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the aural similarity in pronunciation of the competing marks, I find that they share a very high degree of aural similarity.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-SG"><strong>Conceptual Similarity</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering whether there is conceptual similarity, the inquiry is directed at the ideas that lie behind or inform the marks or signs in question: <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> at [70]. However, the consideration of these ideas that lie behind the mark is limited to an analysis of the concepts that can be derived from the elements present in the sign at surface value: <b><i>Lacoste v Carolina Herrera Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/85759-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] SGIPOS 3</a></nobr></b> at [56], citing <b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [34] and <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [34]-[37].</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competing marks, "BODYPACK" and "BODYPAC" would appear to the average consumer as two words, "BODY" and "PACK", that have been put together to convey the impression of a "pack" or something similar such as a "pouch" or other small bag that can be slung across or carried on the "body".&nbsp; Given that "PAC" is meaningless in and of itself, the average consumer may think of it as either a "PACK" (by mental association with the word "PACK"), therefore giving it the same conceptual meaning, or the average consumer may think of it as a word used to describe some type of gear that is used or carried or associated with the "body". The words "digital case" in the Registered Mark may convey the concept of it being a case for digital products that is a subset of a pack for the body (e.g. a handphone pouch slung across the body, or a laptop case strapped to the body).&nbsp; In my mind, it does not change the general concept of the mark such as to render it conceptually different from the Applicants' Mark.&nbsp; I find that the competing marks are therefore conceptually similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Conclusion on marks similarity</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the Registered Mark and the Applicants' Mark have a substantial degree of aural similarity, and a moderate degree of visual and conceptual similarity.

Goods and services will be regarded as identical where they are registered or to be registered in the same class and specification in opposition proceedings, while in the infringement context it will be permissible to have regard to the classification in which the allegedly infringing item or service would have been inserted had the alleged infringer sought registration of his mark.

The High Court agreed with the Appellant and held at [71]-[73] of <b><i>Festina</i></b> that these goods were similar, except for "walking sticks, whips, harness and saddlery":</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Appellant rightly observed, there is a growing phenomenon of brands expanding into goods of various kinds in recent years. Sometimes, the crossing-over takes place between goods that one does not commonly associate with each other, for instance, cigarettes and clothing. The idea of licensing out one's trade mark or engaging in a sister brand or diffusion line has inevitably led to the same trade mark being found on a multitude of goods available in the market. In this regard, there is force in the Appellant's submissions that there is a sense of "relatedness" between goods such as necklaces and clothing and a broad classification of these items as "fashion accessories" or "lifestyle goods" may be justified.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">British Sugar</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">([66]</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">supra</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) test to the present facts, it would be reasonable in the modern context to regard the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 (trunks and suitcases and, in some instances, even umbrellas and parasols) and 25 as complementary in nature and are likely to be of similar uses, targeting almost identical end users and employing similar if not identical trade channels by which the goods reach the market. Thus, there is</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">some</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">similarity between "necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches" in the Respondent's application and the goods for which the Appellant's other marks are registered in Classes 9, 18 (the items specified above) and 25.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Appellant's inclusion of the other goods in Class 18, such as walking sticks, whips, harness and saddlery, as "fashion accessories" would appear to be too over-reaching. To say that these items are "fashion accessories" which are</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">similar to</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">"necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, medal and brooches" would be to put an unnatural strain on the average consumer's perception of what fashion accessories are. Thus, these items are not similar to the Class 14 goods in the Respondent's application.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b>, the Appellant's goods comprised of a "Nutello" beverage, described as "a new gourmet hot coffee beverage served in a shot glass under the "Nutello" sign in its cafes" and with ingredients comprising of "espresso, milk foam, cocoa powder and nutella spread, amongst others." (<b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [4]) The Respondent had registered various trade marks, including a plain word mark "NUTELLA" for, <i>inter alia</i>, "chocolate products" (<b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [3]).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal cautioned at [46] that "the concept of similarity of goods should not be over extended or be interpreted too broadly" and held at [48] that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">We do acknowledge that the "chocolate products" specification could, on a plain reading of the term, cover a whole range of foodstuff and items. It could include things like chocolate powder, mocha, or even items like chocolate-flavoured body lotion. However, it is not true that simply because of this holding the Respondent would <i>ipso facto</i> have a monopoly of the "Nutella" word, or closely related variations, over what is an extensive range of all chocolate products imaginable. This is because a registered owner still needs to establish further the third element, namely, likelihood of confusion, in order to make out a successful case of trade mark infringement.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal noted that the <i>British Sugar</i> test was difficult to apply to that case because of the need to compare the Appellant's product not only with the actual Nutella product (i.e. the Nutella spread) but also with the specification of the registration (i.e. "chocolate products"). The court went on to consider each of the <i>British Sugar</i> factors for "a narrow comparison between two actual products", but stated that if the proper comparison is between the Appellant's beverage and the specification "chocolate product", the <i>British Sugar</i> test may not be applicable, <b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [53]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Having said that, <b>if the proper comparison to be made is between the Nutello beverage and the "chocolate product" registration specification, which we think is the case, then many of the</b></span> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">British Sugar</span></b></em> <b><span lang="EN-GB">factors may not be applicable as they were premised on comparing two actual products. In so far as the specification of the "Nutella" mark extends to products which have not yet been produced by the Respondent, then the</span></b> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">British Sugar</span></b></em> <b><span lang="EN-GB">factors may not be entirely helpful in the conduct of the similarity analysis. At the end of the day, the question would depend on whether the Nutello beverage can be considered a "chocolate product". From the evidence from the market survey and internet blogs, various consumers have commented on the Nutello beverage's chocolate nature (such as its chocolate taste and chocolate content). This indicates rather persuasively that the Nutello beverage has in practice been regarded as a "chocolate product" by those who have consumed it. While not conclusive, it shows that the Nutello beverage can be considered to fall within the "chocolate product" specification.</span></b> <span lang="EN-GB">Bearing in mind that the "chocolate product" specification is not only restricted to the traditional solid form of chocolate products, but also encompasses all forms or textures such as powder and even viscous liquids/viscous products like the Nutella spread and the Nutello beverage, the similarity is obvious. It seems to us that one reason the Judge refrained from holding that the "Nutello" product was a chocolate product (</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">ie</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, identical to a chocolate product) was essentially because under the same Class 30 of ICGS there are the following separate categories of goods: "Beverages (Chocolate-based)", "Beverages (Cocoa-based)", "Chocolate beverages with milk" and "Chocolate-based beverages". Although the Respondent could have done so, it did not register the "Nutella" mark against these categories of products under the same class. <strong>In the result, we agree with the Judge that the Nutello beverage is not identical but similar to "chocolate products". It seems to us that these products (</strong></span><strong><em><span lang="EN-GB">viz</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, "Beverages (Chocolate-based)", "Beverages (Cocoa-based)", "Chocolate beverages with milk" and "Chocolate-based beverages"</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">et al</span></em></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>), which are listed under the same Class 30 ICGS as "chocolate products", are simply further particularisation of "chocolate products" and are thus similar to "chocolate products".</strong> Of course, had the Respondent registered the "Nutella" mark against "Beverages (Chocolate-based)" or "Chocolate-based beverages", it would probably have been a case of "identical" rather than "similar" products. Therefore, in light of the preceding analysis, we are of the view that the "Nutella" and "Nutello" products are similar.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of opposition proceedings, the Court of Appeal has stated that "it will generally not be relevant to consider extraneous factors that relate to the actual and particular circumstances and the ways in which the mark was used on the goods in question", although, if they are considered, such extraneous factors may be relevant to establish the degree of similarity (and not identity). These "extraneous factors" are "in particular, the uses and the users of the goods and services in question, their inherent nature and the extent to which they are competitive."

(See, generally, <b><i>QS</i></b> at pp 526-7). The distinction appears to have been drawn between what was considered by the Hearing Officer to be sports-related goods and fashion-related goods. There was also evidence by way of statutory declaration by a Mr Eric Holes who stated that "many high street retailers selling clothing and footwear whether under their own trade mark or under the trade marks of others make available goods which could be called fashion accessories, such as umbrellas, purses, handbags and holdalls" and "are associated with clothing by way of styling, colour or other visually distinctive features."</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the registration pertains to "Bags covered in Class 18", which is rather broad.&nbsp; The notional or fair uses of this specification could therefore include a range of bags, whether bags for sports purposes or bags for fashion purposes. However, I also consider the need to strike a balance between allowing for this penumbra of notional and fair uses and not over extending or interpreting the concept of similarity of goods too broadly (see <b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b> at [46]). From the cases of <b><i>Sarika (CA)</i></b>, <b><i>QS</i></b> and <b><i>Festina</i></b>, the court considers the evidence tendered to determine the possible uses, users, inherent nature of the goods and the extent to which they are competitive.&nbsp; In the present case, there is some evidence that the Applicants' goods are for outdoor sports activities such as camping and hiking e.g. YKC-3, p 32 of the Applicants' SD, in a newspaper article which describes the Applicants' physical store as "a chain of stores that caters to lovers of the great outdoors." Further down the article, the description of the store reads, "Lining its walls are rows of backpacks, boots, sleeping bags, travel wallets, tents, waterproof jackets and sandals."&nbsp; I would however not place emphasis on the manner in which the goods are marketed, such as the name of the Applicants' store "Sports Connection", since the Court of Appeal has specifically emphasized that "it will not be relevant to have regard to the particular way in which the goods or services have been affixed with the mark and are then being marketed" (<b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [84]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants' goods, "Bags covered in Class 18" could conceivably include all types of bags for sports and also related sports merchandise. I would however draw the line at goods that are more fashion-related, as they would probably be sold in different stores (i.e. fashion stores and not sports stores).&nbsp; The uses and users of sports related goods would therefore be the same.&nbsp;</span> <span lang="EN-GB">However, the uses and users of fashion related goods would be different.&nbsp; Indeed, the Applicants have themselves identified some of these as fashion related goods in their submissions, categorizing them as goods that are “more commonly viewed as "fashion apparels and accessories" (see paragraph [172] of the Applicants' Supplemental Submissions):</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">belts [clothing], boots, footwear, gloves [clothing], headgear for wear, hoods [clothing] jackets [clothing], jumpers [shirt fronts], motorists' clothing, outerclothing, overalls, overcoats, pants, parkas, pullovers, ready-made clothing, sandals, scarves, shoes, skirts, stocking, stuff jackets [clothing] and vests</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that these goods are likely to be in the category of "fashion apparels and accessories", although "ready-made clothing" could possibly refer to a category of sports merchandise as well.&nbsp; In light of <b><i>QS</i></b>, "clothing" and "ready-made clothing" could be considered to be similar to bags, if they both have the same uses and users and are therefore likely to be found within the same shelves in a department store or even the same stores. In the present case, "clothing" and "bags" could share the same uses (ie. for outdoor sports activities) and users (ie. outdoor sports enthusiasts), and such goods would be found in the same type of stores, ie. stores selling outdoor sports clothing, bags, and perhaps some related accessories, or perhaps the same shelves (eg. sports section) in large department stores.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note, however, that the recent case of <b><i>Asos</i></b> appears to take a different position from <b><i>QS</i></b>. There, the General Court held that there was no goods similarity between “bumbags; sports bags; casual bags; briefcases; attaché cases; satchels; beauty cases; credit card cases and holders; wallets; purses” in Class 18 and clothing, footwear, headgear’ in Class 25, even if they shared the same distribution channels and have the same end users (see <b><i>Asos</i></b> at [51]). The General Court noted in the same paragraph that the intervener’s argument that the goods in Class 18 and Class 25 cited above shared the same manufacturer was not substantiated.&nbsp; The General Court also found that (1) the goods in Class 18 had an “utilitarian function” whilst the goods in Class 25 had an “aesthetic function” and (2) the purchase of the goods in Class 18 and Class 25 should be viewed independently, because the average consumer would purchase the goods in Class 18 “without worrying about the concomitant possession or purchase” of the goods in Class 25, and vice versa (see, <b><i>Asos</i></b> at [49]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">The reasoning in <b><i>Asos</i></b> on this issue differs from our High Court’s reasoning in <b><i>Festina</i></b>, which concluded at [72] (cited above at paragraph [57]) that it was the "complementary" nature of the goods in Class 18 and Class 25 and the fact that there were</span> likely to be of similar uses, targeting almost identical end users and employing similar if not identical trade channels by which the goods reach the market” contributed to the finding that there is some similarity between “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” (Class 18) and the goods in Class 25.&nbsp; Following the reasoning in <b><i>Festina</i></b>, I find that, based on the likelihood of similarity in the uses, end users and marketing channels of the Applicants’ Class 18 goods and some of the Registered Proprietors’ Class 25 goods, some of them will be regarded as similar (see paragraph [68] below).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the various specifications in light of the considerations above, I find that the following goods in the Registered Proprietors' specification in Class 25 are similar to that of the Applicants' goods in Class 18:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Bandanas [neckerchiefs], beach clothes, beach shoes,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">boots,boots for sports, boots (iron fittings for-), boots (welts for-), cap peaks, caps [headwear], clothing, clothing for gymnastics, coats, cyclists' clothing, fishing vests, fittings of metal for shoes and boots, football boots, football shoes,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">footwear,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">footwear (tips for-), footwear uppers, gaiters,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">gloves [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">gymnastic shoes, hats, headbands [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">headgear for wear,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">heelpieces for boots and shoes, inner soles,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">jackets [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">jackets (stuff-) [clothing], jerseys [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">jumpers [shirt fronts], motorists' clothing,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">non-slipping devices for boots and shoes,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">outerclothing, pants, ready-made clothing, sandals, shoes,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">shoes (iron fittings for-), shoes (non-slipping devices for-), shoes (welts for-), shoulder wraps, shower caps, ski boots,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">skirts,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">skull caps, sock suspenders, socks, soles for footwear, sports (boots for-), sports jerseys, sports shoes, stocking suspenders,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">stocking,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">stockings (sweat-absorbent-), straps (gaiter-), studs for football boots [shoes],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">stuff jackets [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">suits (bathing-), sun visors, sweat-absorbent underclothing [underwear], sweaters, swimsuits, Tee-shirts, tips for footwear, trunks (bathing-), underclothing, underclothing (anti-sweat-),</span> <span lang="EN-GB">vests,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">vests (fishing-), waterproof clothing; all included in Class 25.("<b>Class 25 Similar Goods</b>")</span></p> <p class="Judg-1">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I find it difficult to imagine that some of these goods, e.g. "bath sandals", "heels", "underpants" or "neckties" have both fashion and sports utility. Whilst I am open to the Applicants' suggestion that there may be a possibility of "brand licensing" or "sister branding" between fashion and sports merchandise, there is no evidence to substantiate this proposition. To call these items "sports merchandise" would, as phrased by the High Court in <b><i>Festina</i></b> at [73] (cited above at paragraph [57]), "put an unnatural strain on the average consumer's perception" of what sports merchandise are. It is quite unlikely that these goods, which can perhaps be found in purely fashion-focused stores and/or the general shoes/underwear/accessories sections in department stores, will also be found in sports stores or in the sports section of department stores.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of any evidence, I am not able to find the link between sports and fashion, as suggested in a bare statement by the Applicants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I find that the following goods in the Registered Proprietors' specification in Class 25 are dissimilar to that of the Applicants' specification in Class 18:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">bath sandals, bath slippers,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">belts [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">belts (money-) [clothing], braces for clothing [suspenders], clothing of imitations of leather, clothing of leather, coats (top-), esparto shoes or sandals; heelpieces for stockings, heels,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">hoods [clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">knitwear [clothing], lace boots,layettes [clothing], linen (body-) [garments], mittens, money belts [clothing], neckties,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">overalls, overcoats,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">pajamas (Am.),</span> <span lang="EN-GB">parkas, pullovers,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">pyjamas, ready-made linings [parts of clothing],</span> <span lang="EN-GB">scarves,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">shirt fronts, shirts yokes, shirts, slips [undergarments], trouser straps, trousers, underpants, underwear, uniforms, visors [hatmaking], waistcoats.

These are: (i) the similarity between the registered mark and the allegedly infringing mark; (ii) the similarity or identity between the goods or services in relation to which the marks are used; and (iii) the relevant segment of the public in relation to whom the court must consider the likelihood of confusion. …[A]s to the relevant segment of the public, there may be characteristics that are particular to the group in question…As an illustrative proposition, the likelihood of confusion must be greater where, say, the contesting marks are similar to a high degree, the goods are identical in nature and the segment of the public in question is undistinguished in its attention than would be the case if the marks and the goods are somewhat similar but not exceedingly so, and the relevant segment of the public happens to be highly knowledgeable and very fastidious...</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the <i>effects</i> of the similarity of marks and the similarity of goods on the relevant segment of the public, extraneous factors may be considered, although these are subject to some important qualifications, as stated in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [84]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">First, <b>in opposition proceedings, it will generally <i>not</i> be relevant to consider extraneous factors that relate to the actual and particular circumstances and ways in which the mark was used on the goods in question.</b> While it will be necessary to consider the notional or fair uses to which each of the marks could be put, for instance, in terms of what types of goods or services are within the contemplated uses for which the mark has been registered, it will not be relevant to have regard to the particular way in which the goods or services have been affixed with the mark and are then being marketed. This would thus exclude consideration of such factors such as differences in the intended market segments, trading strategies employed, websites used or the trader's chosen limitations as to his use of the mark…It would denude of significance the critical distinction we have drawn between infringement and opposition proceedings if the confusion inquiry were diverted into a consideration rooted in the details of the actual circumstances in which the goods or services affixed with the mark are being marketed. (Emphasis added)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">The Court of Appeal elaborated on the types of extraneous factors allowed at [95]-[96], as follows:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the risk of origin-based confusion is the primary interest sought to be protected by trade mark law, there must be a limit to the range of external factors that may be taken into account to determine whether a sufficient likelihood of such confusion exists. <b>The permissible factors are those which (a) are intrinsic to the very nature of the goods and/or (b) affect the impact that the similarity of marks and goods has on the consumer.</b> The impermissible factors are those differences between the competing marks and goods which are created by a trader's differentiating steps. In other words, factors which are not inherent in the goods, but are susceptible to changes that can be made by a trader from time to time, should not be permissible considerations. In particular, we are satisfied that it is unnecessary, unworkable and impermissible for the court to have regard to such issues as pricing differentials, packaging and other superficial marketing choices which could possibly be made by the trader. In contrast, <b>extraneous factors that relate to the <i>purchasing practices</i> and <i>degree of care</i> paid by the consumer when acquiring goods of the sort in question, can be considered and assessed without descending into the details of particular differentiating steps which the trader might choose to take in relation to the goods and services falling within the specification.</b></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on these considerations, the following represents a non-exhaustive list of factors which we regard as admissible in the confusion inquiry:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity on consumer perception: the degree of similarity of the marks themselves (see <i>Hai Tong</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>) at [85(c)(iii)], the reputation of the marks (see <i>Polo (CA)</i> ([8] <i>supra</i>) at [34]), the impression given by the marks (see <i>Polo (CA)</i> at [28]), and the possibility of imperfect recollection of the marks would all be relevant. <b>Clearly, the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion.</b> As to the reputation of the mark, <i>Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc v Hyundai Mobis</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> ("<i>Mobil</i>") at [74] makes it clear that a strong reputation does not necessarily equate to a higher likelihood of confusion, and could in fact have the contrary effect as in <i>McDonald's Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0177.xml&#39;)">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177</a> (see at [64]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception: it would be legitimate to take into account factors concerning the very nature of the goods without implicating any steps that are taken by the trader to differentiate the goods. <b>This includes the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type</b> (see [20] above, <i>Mystery Drinks</i> at [48], <i>Lloyd</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 1352; and <i>Phillips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at [55]). This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, <b>it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers</b> (see generally <i>Hai Tong</i> at [85(c)(i)]), <b>and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase<i>.</i></b> (Emphasis added)</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity on consumer perception</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found at paragraph [45] above that the competing marks in the present case have a substantial degree of aural similarity and a moderate degree of visual and conceptual similarity. Given the high degree to which both the competing marks are similar, there is likely to be a greater likelihood of confusion. There is also undisputed evidence that there has been substantial sales of goods bearing the Applicants' Mark (see below at paragraph [90(c)]) and substantial expenditure on advertising and promotion of the Applicants' Mark (see below at paragraph [90(a)]).&nbsp; There is also undisputed evidence that the Applicants <span lang="EN-GB">enjoyed some 25-30% of the market share for backpacks (</span>see below at paragraph [90(f)]) and that they had four outlets at relatively well-known shopping locations in Singapore, namely, <span lang="EN-GB">Queensway Shopping Centre, Shaw Leisure Gallery, West Mall and Compass Point (</span>see below at paragraph [90(e)]).These factors indicate that the Applicants have some degree of reputation amongst the public in Singapore, or at least amongst the general public who require sports, outdoor or camping gear.</p> <p class="Judg-1">75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have decided that the Class 25 Dissimilar Goods are dissimilar, it is not necessary for me to consider further whether there is a likelihood of confusion in respect of these goods.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception</span></strong></p> <p class="Judg-1">76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumers of the Applicants' goods would ordinarily purchase them via the Applicants' physical stores (see paragraph [90(e)]). The Applicants also submit that both their goods and the Registered Proprietors' goods would be found on shelves in a department store, or at least within the same shop or store (Applicants' Supplemental Submissions,[166]-[170]). The goods in this case may be described as affordably-priced bags, clothes, and related accessories thereto, some for sports, outdoor or camping use(see Applicants' SD at pp 90-94). This suggests that consumers would tend to spend a lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention when buying these products. They may also not have a particularly high level of care or have specialist knowledge when making their purchases. As such, it is likely that for those goods which are similar (ie. Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods), there would be a likelihood of confusion, given that these goods are likely to share the same uses and users (discussed above at paragraphs [63]-[68]).</p> <p class="Judg-1">77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Class 25 Dissimilar Goods, I have already discussed above (see paragraphs [63]-[68]) how they are dissimilar, given that they do not share the same uses and users, as they appear to be a range of purely fashion-related goods, as opposed to the sports-related goods. As such, it is not necessary for me to consider further the issue of likelihood of confusion.</p> <p class="Judg-1">78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, for the goods which are considered identical or similar, the purchasing practices and degree of care taken by consumers of these relatively inexpensive goods are likely, on a balance of probabilities, to result in a likelihood of confusion.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><strong>Conclusion on likelihood of confusion</strong></p> <p class="Judg-1">79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the degree of similarity between the competing marks and the permissible extraneous factors in relation to both marks similarity and goods similarity on consumer confusion, I find that there is a likelihood of confusion between the Applicants' Mark and the Registered Mark, as regards Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods. The third limb of the test under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act is satisfied to this extent.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><strong>Partial Invalidation under Section 23</strong></p> <p class="Judg-1">80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Section 23(9) of the Act provides for partial invalidation of a trade mark.

I will therefore consider the evidence tendered in this case and determine the scope of goodwill that exists in the Applicants' business, as represented by the Applicants' Mark as well as in the text component "BODYPAC."</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Distinctiveness of Applicants' Mark</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first consider whether the Applicants' Mark is a "distinctive indicia capable of being the [vessel] of goodwill" (as was considered by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b>, in relation to the "Aman" names).&nbsp; This is important since, as a general rule, words that are descriptive of a trader's goods or services do not denote or indicate origin or the source of the goods or services supplied.&nbsp; Examples of "descriptive" names include: "COFFEEMIX" (referring to a mixture of coffee, sugar and non-dairy creamer) in <b><i>Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte Ltd</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0214.xml&#39;)">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 214</a></b>; "3 in 1" (a descriptor on paint which identified the inherent qualities of "Covers Crack, Washable and Waterproof") in <b><i>Nippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paints (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0465.xml&#39;)">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 465</a></b> at [25], amongst others: <b>Susanna H S Leong, <i>Intellectual Property Law of Singapore</i> (2013)</b>, at [35.032].</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants submitted that in relation to the Applicants' Mark, "the word "BODYPAC" clearly stands out from the background of the [Applicants'] Mark" and that "BODYPAC" is an inherently distinctive word, because it is "meaningless or has no discernible correlation to the product or service in question" and "serves no purpose other than as a mark or badge of origin or source of that product or service", citing <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> at [29] (see Applicants' written submissions at [42]-[43]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, I find that the word "BODYPAC" has sufficient inherent distinctiveness, perhaps to a medium degree. The word "BODYPAC" is not completely "meaningless or has no discernible correlation to the product or service in question", unlike the examples given in the second half of <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> at [29] such as "Eureka" for shirts, "June" for toiletries, and "Puffin" or "Penguin" for chocolate-coated sandwich biscuits.&nbsp; The word "BODYPAC" evokes the words "Body" and "Pack" and thus brings to mind a pack for the body (as was also submitted by the Applicants themselves in relation to conceptual similarity: see Applicants' written submissions at [56]). A pack for the body would have some loose correlation to some kind of bag.&nbsp; That said, the word "BODYPAC" and the Applicants' Mark (comprising of the word "BODYPAC" and the inverted triangle device) is also not a purely descriptive term for "bags", unlike the examples ("COFFEEMIX" and "3-n-1" given in paragraph [93] above). The words "Body" and "Pac" subverts the usual syntax for a description of a "pack" that is carried on the "body". The visual distinctiveness of the word is further enhanced by the elimination of the letter "k" from the word "pack", leaving behind the three letters "pac", which, when combined together as "BODYPAC", creates the impression of an invented word.&nbsp; The Applicants' Mark is further enhanced by the addition of a device that appears to be the outline of a mountain or perhaps an inverted triangle, making it even more visually distinctive.&nbsp; As such, both "BODYPAC" and the Applicants' Mark are capable of being "vessels of goodwill."</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [44], the Court of Appeal has explained that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">In our view, goodwill is not an all-or-nothing attribute in that it is not the case that the plaintiff either has goodwill in Singapore, or otherwise, has no goodwill at all. Clearly, goodwill can be limited to sections of the public. These sections can be small so long as they are not negligible. However, if goodwill is shown to exist only among a small section of the public in Singapore, it would mean that, while goodwill exists in this country, it exists only in relation to that small group and not to the entire public here at large.</span></p> <p class="MsoListParagraph"><span lang="EN-GB">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this principle, the Court of Appeal turned to examine various aspects of goodwill such as the specific sector of the public to be considered and the type of business in respect of which the goodwill exists.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the first aspect of goodwill, i.e. the specific sector of the public to be considered. The Applicants have submitted that the specific sector of the public in this case would be "the distributors as well as retail customers of the Applicants' bags in Singapore." To support their submission, the Applicants refer to a list of their 1,228 third party retailer accounts in Exhibit YKC-13 of the Applicants' SD. This list is titled "Wholesales / Customers Listing as at July 2012 (sic)."</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the evidence in the Applicants' SD, as described at paragraph [90] above, I find that there is goodwill amongst retail customers in Singapore i.e. the</span> general public who require sports, outdoor or camping gear. <span lang="EN-GB">This is proved by the evidence of sales from the Applicants to various retail customers such as Paris Department Store Pte Ltd, Phua Kuan Meng Fashion, The Mahaprajna Buddhist Society and Wei Teck Kun (Brothers) Trading P/L c/o Hua Ho Department Store (see details at [90(d)(ix)]).&nbsp; There is also a consistent trend of sales between Aug 1994 and 2008 which is supported by samples of invoices over the years (1989, 1994, 2001, 2005, 2007) showing that the Applicants have paid for deliveries of "BODYPAC" bags to Singapore and have made sales to various retail outlets in Singapore (see details at [90(c)], [90(d)(i)]-[(viii)] above).&nbsp; However, there is no documentary evidence of the Applicants coming into contact with distributors in Singapore for the purpose of retailing the relevant goods. The receipts tendered show that the Applicants sell the relevant goods directly to department stores or individual customers. Any contact with distributors <i>per se</i> is left to be presumed from the volume of sales and perhaps the "Wholesales/Customer Listing (sic)" dated July 2012, which is beyond the relevant date of 4 September 2008.&nbsp; I am therefore reluctant to find that goodwill exists in relation to the distributors of the Applicants' relevant goods in Singapore.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning back to evidence of goodwill amongst retail customers, there is also evidence of the Applicants' consistent expenditure on advertisement and promotion of their goods, for about 16 consecutive years (1992 – 2008). During some of these years, the expenditure reached more than S$200,000 (in 1995-1998), although it was much less in some years (e.g. S$914 in 2007, S$4,378 in 2008).&nbsp; Even though the documentary proof supporting these figures is relatively thin (see paragraph [90(a)] above), it is important to remember that these facts have been deemed admitted by the Registered Proprietors. The Applicants also enjoyed some 25-30% of the market share for backpacks (see paragraph [90(f)] above) and were the subject of a local newspaper feature in 1997, which made reference to "BODYPAC" bags.&nbsp; This statement is not supported by any documentary proof, but has been deemed admitted by the Registered Proprietors as well.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next aspect of goodwill is whether the word "BODYPAC" and the Applicants' Mark have the requisite "attractive force for bringing in custom among the relevant sector of the public." As stated in <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [60]-[63], the fact that the relevant incidia are generally known does not necessarily mean that they have goodwill, since there could be instances where the well-known good is unavailable for sale (as in <b><i>Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar NP</i> <nobr>[1984] FSR 413</nobr></b>) or where it is priced out of reach of those who desire it (as in <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> itself, where the Court of Appeal held that goodwill could not extend to those who are less well off and could not afford to pay to stay at the Aman resorts). Perhaps this could also be expressed as the difference between "reputation" and "goodwill": whilst reputation can exist without a supporting business relationship, goodwill cannot exist on its own but instead attaches to a business in the jurisdiction and is manifested in the custom it in fact enjoys: <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> at [21].&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the evidence shows that the Applicants and its predecessor, Sports Connection (as sole proprietor), both had their place of business in Singapore. The Applicants in particular were incorporated in Singapore (see YKC-1 and YKC-2 in the Applicants' SD). Both the Applicants and its predecessor were managed by the same Mr Yee Kok Chew (see [1] and [6] of the Applicants' SD). The newspaper article dated 29 August 1997 (see paragraph [90(b)] above) attributed the name "BODYPAC" to Mr Yee Kok Chew. The invoices relating to the delivery and sales of the relevant "BODYPAC" goods (bags) were all addressed to the Applicants or its predecessor in Singapore. The Applicants also had a business presence in Singapore by means of the four retail outlets that they operated across various locations in Singapore (see paragraph [90(e)] above).&nbsp; As such, I find that the word "BODYPAC" and the Applicants' Mark have the requisite "attractive force for bringing in custom among the relevant sector of the public," which is the</span> general public who require sports, outdoor or camping gear.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the third aspect ie. <i>the type of business in respect of which goodwill exists</i>, the Applicants submit, in a paragraph, that their goodwill exists "in relation to the Applicants' distribution and consumer business for its bags." This submission is uncontested, unlike in the cases of <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> and <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b>.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b>, the respondents claimed that they had "substantial reputation and goodwill, both in Singapore and worldwide, in the "Aman" names and "Aman"-prefixed names when those names were used in relation to hotels, resorts, and residential accommodation (<b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [43]). However, on appeal, they appeared to clarify that they are claiming goodwill only in respect of "the high-end hotel and resort market."&nbsp; The appellants argued that goodwill did not extend to residential accommodation (<b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [65]). The Court of Appeal, after examining the facts, accepted the appellants' argument and held that the goodwill was limited to "the high-end hotel and resort market."&nbsp; In <b><i>The Singapore Professional Golfers' Association v Chen Eng Waye and others</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0699.xml&#39;)">[2012] 3 SLR 699</a></nobr> (High Court)</b>, the plaintiff had tried to argue that its name and initials had acquired goodwill in Singapore in relation to golf-related activities generally, whilst the defendant had tried to argue that the plaintiff's goodwill only extended to <i>senior</i> professional golfers (ie. a professional golfer who has reached the age of 50) and not to professional golfers activities generally. The High Court found, on the facts, that whilst the plaintiff did not have separate membership or organize activities specifically for senior professional golfers, they did arrange for senior members to take part in senior professional golf tournaments.&nbsp; This part of the decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal which held that the High Court had found that the appellants "did have a measure of goodwill in relation to professional golfing activities generally and was not limited to activities that pertained only to senior professional golfers" (<b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> at [24]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No distinction has been made within the categories of "distribution" and "consumer" businesses for bags generally, and there is no evidence as regards the bag industry to differentiate between the two types of business. On the basis of the evidence before me, the Applicants' goodwill in the word "BODYPAC" and Applicants' Mark exists generally in relation to the business of selling bags to retail consumers in Singapore. This is shown particularly through their consistent annual sales figures that are supported by invoices of sales to various retail customers between 2001 and 2008, as well as the fact that their brand enjoyed some 25-30% of the market share for backpacks (see paragraphs 90(c), (d)(ix) and (f) above).&nbsp; The Applicants may also have been in the distribution business then, but unfortunately, it is not clear if the evidence of their wholesale and customer listing was in existence as at 4 September 2008. The High Court and Court of Appeal in the <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> case noted that there was evidence of the plaintiff's goodwill in relation to both senior professional golfers as well as professional golfers generally in deciding that their goodwill related to both categories of persons.&nbsp; In our present case, the evidence is uncertain and therefore, I am unable to find that there is goodwill in respect of the distributors for bags generally.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Misrepresentation</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [69]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">In order to establish an actionable tort of passing off, the plaintiff, apart from proving that it has goodwill in the goods, services or business in question, must also show that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the defendant made a misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the public; and</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such misrepresentation has resulted in or is likely to result in damage to the plaintiff's goodwill.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the content of the misrepresentation, the Applicants have not identified any particular instances of misrepresentation.

They further submit that the target audience of the misrepresentation would be the distributors and retail consumers in Singapore that actually or potentially purchase the Applicants' bags. They also submit that due to the high degree of similarity of the marks and the identity of the goods, there is a strong likelihood of confusion among the relevant segment of the public, in that they would believe that "BODYPAC" and "BODYPACK" bags come from the same economic undertaking, the latter being a "variation for a special product line for bags for digital devices." They also refer to instances of "actual" confusion and point towards evidence in the Applicants' SD that a retailer had recorded a purchase for a "BODYPACK" bag as a purchase for a "BODYPAC" bag instead. In addition, Google "Web" and "Image" searches for "BODYPAC bag" returned multiple results showing that the use of "BODYPACK" by the Registered Proprietors has resulted in confusion in the market.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The relevant sector of the public</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the misrepresentation must be one that gives rise to confusion. It is the two elements of misrepresentation and confusion that together form the element of "deception", which is at the heart of the tort of passing off: <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [77], cited in <b><i>Professional Golfers</i></b> at [42].</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> considered the question of misrepresentation according to three broad headers, namely, (i) the content of the misrepresentation (ii) the target audience of the misrepresentation&nbsp; and (iii) whether the misrepresentation resulted in confusion (<b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [70]-[93]).&nbsp; I adopt the same framework for analysis in the present case.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The content of the misrepresentation</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their submissions it is not entirely clear if the Applicants are relying on the actual use of the Registered Mark by the Registered Proprietors (alluded to the instance of "actual confusion") or if they are relying on the notional fair use of the Registered Mark (since they refer generally to their submissions in Section 8(2) of the Act) (see paragraphs [107]-[108] above). I note however that the uses of the <i>Registered Mark</i> by the Registered Proprietors that are referred to by the Applicants are either undated or after the relevant date of 4 September 2008, namely, (a) the signage of a mark similar to the Registered Mark used by a store called "BONKERS", supported by evidence of an undated photograph of the store front (see Applicants' written submissions at [68]) (undated), and (b) the Google "web" and "image" searches for "BODYPAC bag" and also Exhibit YKC-26 (beyond the relevant date).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent decision of <b><i>Jamal Abdulnaser Mahmoud Al Mahamid v Global Tobacco Manufacturers (International) Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/16954-SSP.xml&#39;)">[2015] SGHC 42</a></nobr> ("<i>Jamal</i>"),</b> an invalidation case, the High Court noted at [59] that</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">I note that in <i><span class="">Staywell</span></i> the Court of Appeal held that a difference exists between confusion in the context of opposition proceedings under s 8(2) as compared to infringement proceedings under s 27(2) of the Act (at [56]–[61]). In the former, as monopoly rights are sought, confusion is measured against notional fair use. In contrast, as infringement proceedings are not at all concerned with the exercise of monopoly rights, but only whether the actual use of one mark has encroached on the rights conferred upon the holder of another mark. <b>In the present case [invalidation], where both marks have been registered, and there is no question of infringement, the issue is a tussle between competing and incompatible monopoly rights.

If that is the case, then we are concerned with the <i>possible</i> misrepresentation by the Registered Proprietors in using the Registered Mark in the classes they are registered for.&nbsp; However, this has to be properly supported by submissions and evidence.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Whether the misrepresentation caused confusion</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from the passage above that the likelihood of confusion is an essential element of the tort of passing off.&nbsp; However, the fact that there is a likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act does not automatically mean that there has been an actionable misrepresentation under Section 8(7)(a) of the Act. The differences between the tort of passing off and a claim for trade mark infringement were noted by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> at [109]-[110].&nbsp; In particular, it was held that "the test in the tort of passing off is probably a more demanding one than the corresponding inquiry in a trade mark infringement action" in that it is necessary to show "that the defendant's actions amount to a misrepresentation that is likely to deceive the relevant segment of the public", and this likelihood of deception is to be assessed having regard to all the circumstances.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found that there is a likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act between the Registered Mark and the Application Mark in relation to Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods (see paragraphs [71]-[79] above).&nbsp; The other facts and circumstances of the present case are as follows:</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Applicants and the Registered Proprietors' goods are affordable, every day bags for outdoor use;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants' evidence shows that the Registered Proprietors have not made actual use of the Registered Mark <i>per se</i> prior to the relevant date;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the Applicants' evidence, there are court documents pertaining to Suit No. 873/2005/N (the "<b>Suit</b>") where one Tay Chwee Heng states on affidavit that an entity called "PT Eigerindo MPI in Indonesia" had sold bags bearing various signs ranging from "bp" (in a lower-case, unique font), "BODYPACK" with "bp" device (in unique font), "BODYPACK streetgear", "#96", "it's all about style on the street" (used in combination, in a standard font), "BODYPACK streetgear" with "bp" device (standard font) (collectively, the "<b>Varied Bodypack Signs</b>") (see pp 220-224 of the Applicants' SD) on several types of bags for casual wear.&nbsp; The Varied Bodypack Signs, are essentially quite different in typeface, font, and style compared to the Registered Mark, although they share the word "BODYPACK" in common;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants claim that Tay Chwee Heng had obtained the bags from the Registered Proprietors;</span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants' director had met with the Registered Proprietors' representative in 1992 and given him 5-6 pieces of their "BODYPAC" bags for quotation and sample production.

The deceptive conduct of the Registered Proprietors pertains to the goods in Class 18, ie. bags, only.&nbsp; There is no evidence as to any likelihood of deception as to the goods in Class 25.&nbsp; Therefore, I find that there is misrepresentation by the Registered Proprietors as to the goods in Class 18, but not the goods in Class 25.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Damage</strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to damage in the form of being deprived from expanding into the market for selling bags and suitcases for digital devices, the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> held at [125] that</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">…Where the field in which the defendant or applicant operates is in close proximity to, or is a natural extension of, the incumbent's business damage in the form of a restriction of business expansion opportunities will be more readily inferred...</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Applicants and the Registered Proprietors' goods are almost identical, in that they are essentially bags for everyday use.

As stated in Section 2(8) of the Act:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Where it is determined that a trade mark is well known to any relevant sector of the public in Singapore, the trade mark shall be deemed to be well known in Singapore.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2(7) of the Act further provides a list of non-exhaustive factors to be taken into account when determining whether a trade mark is well known to the relevant sector of the public in Singapore. Of these factors, Section 2(7)(a) of the Act is “arguably the most crucial factor when determining whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore”: <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> at [139]. Section 2(7)(a) provides that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to [s 2(8)], in deciding, for the purposes of this Act [<i>ie</i>, the current TMA], whether a trade mark is well known in Singapore, it shall be relevant to take into account any matter from which it may be inferred that the trade mark is well known, including such of the following matters as may be relevant:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the degree to which the trade mark is known to or recognised by any relevant sector of the public in Singapore;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Applicants submit that the relevant sector of the public are “the distributors, as well as retail customers of the Applicant’s goods in Singapore” (Applicants’ written submissions at [88]). The basis of their submission is the evidence of sales of goods to its consumers in Sports Connection outlets as well as their list of distributor partners and “business-to-business transactions dealing with bulk orders from its distributors.” However, I have already expressed my doubts as to the relevance of this evidence at paragraphs [99], [105] above. The other exhibit that the Applicants rely on, in YKC-4, relates to invoices from the Applicants' overseas third party manufacturers, and does not assist to show that it is well known to the relevant public in Singapore.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I have also found that there is sufficient evidence that the Applicants’ goods were sold to various retail customers in Singapore during the relevant time period (see paragraph [99] above). There is also uncontested evidence that the Applicants did operate four retail outlets (paragraph [90(e)] above), a substantial amount of sales was generated (paragraph [90(c)] above), and a substantial amount was spent on promotion and advertisement (paragraph [90(a)] above), all during the relevant time period.&nbsp; The fact that the Applicants had some 25-30% of the market share for backpacks (paragraph [90(f)] above) is also uncontested.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the evidence above, and also bearing in mind my conclusions at paragraph [102] (in relation to goodwill in Section 8(7)(a)), I find that the Applicants’ Mark is known to or recognised by the</span> general public who require sports, outdoor or camping gear.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to (iii), that is, whether the use of the Registered Mark would “indicate a connection” with the Applicants’ Mark.&nbsp; The position in relation to this limb was recently stated in the case of <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [120]:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">As for the third element, the detailed analysis in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Amanresorts</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">([105]</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">supra</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) has put it beyond doubt that the connection requirement of s 8(4)(</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">b</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">)(i) and s 55(3)(</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">a</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) of the Act will be satisfied where there is a likelihood of confusion (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Amanresorts</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [226] and [233]). In</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">([96]</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">supra</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) this court elaborated that a "connection" under s 8(3) of the Act refers to a connection as to origin, a connection as to quality, and business connection. In our view, these types of connections are relevant to 8(4)(</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">b</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">)(i) of the Act as well. Connection as to source and quality (in so far as the public expects goods or services which it thinks emanate from the same source to be of comparable quality (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [48]-[49])) imports classic origin-based confusion, while the business connection imports the misapprehension of an economic relationship between the applicant's products and the incumbent proprietor (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [51]-[52]). In the present case, we have no difficulty in finding that the use of the Applicant Mark in Classes 35 and 43, would give rise to a confusing connection between&nbsp; <span class="">Staywell</span>'s&nbsp; services and the Opponents'. This flows from our earlier finding that the use of the Applicant Mark is likely to give rise to</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">confusion</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">under s 8(2) of the Act, in particular, confusion that the parties' hotels are part of the same chain or are otherwise economically linked.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, following from my decision on confusing similarity (at paragraphs [71] to [79] above), I find that the use of the Registered Mark in Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods is likely to give rise to a confusing connection between the Applicants’ and the Registered Proprietors' goods.&nbsp; The relevant sector of the public is likely to find that the Registered Proprietors' goods are somehow economically linked in that it is a line of goods emanating from the same business source as the Applicants.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I consider factor (iv), ie. whether the use of the Registered Mark is likely to damage the Applicants’ interests.&nbsp; The Applicants submit that in the present case, there is a likelihood of damage to their interests as their ability to introduce a special line of bags or suitcases for digital devices to their brand would be precluded. Currently, they are in the business of selling backpacks for daily practical use, and as such, it would be plausible for them to develop their business to sell bags for digital devices to keep up with today's consumers who own more digital tools and gadgets. Given the proximity of their business, there is a likelihood that the Applicants' business expansion opportunities would be severely limited (Applicants' written submissions at [104]). The Applicants also cite the case of <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b>, where the court accepted that there was a close proximity between the business of operating a 6-star hotel and a 4-star hotel, and Amanresorts, where the court held that the field of high end resorts and hotels were closely connected to residential accommodation business.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [126], the Court of Appeal held that:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-SG">only if there was no such proximity [between the present field of business and the prospective field to be expanded into] would the incumbent have to display a genuine intention to expand into the prospective market. This makes sense because of the need to prevent unwarranted extension of the incumbent’s protection based on the wholly speculative possibility of its future expansion into a market unrelated to its present business.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the question is whether there is sufficient proximity between the Applicants' field of business and the Registered Proprietors' field of business. From my analysis as regards the Class 18 specification that they both have registrations for, I have found that the goods are identical if not highly similar.&nbsp; Essentially, they are both in the field of selling bags for everyday use, whether for sports and outdoor use, or specifically for laptops and/or other digital devices.&nbsp; As discussed earlier in relation to goods similarity (at paragraphs [46]-[70]), the uses and users of these goods are likely to be the same, and they are sold in similar if not the same locations in Singapore.&nbsp; In view of the evidence, and in light of the Court of Appeal's decision in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b>, I find that there is sufficient proximity between the Applicants' field of business and the Registered Proprietors' field of business in relation to bags.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no submissions are before me as to the likelihood of damage in relation to the Registered Mark under Class 25.&nbsp; As decided in <b><i><span class="">Staywell</span></i></b> at [126] (above), there would be a need to display "a genuine intention to expand into the prospective market" in order for there to be a finding of likelihood of damage if the fields of business are not related.&nbsp; I have found earlier that there is a possibility of the goods in Class 18 and Class 25 Similar Goods to be within the same fields of business in that these Class 25 Similar Goods are within the possible penumbra of fair uses, following the cases of <b><i>Festina</i></b> and <b><i>QS</i></b>. In view of the same, the Applicants would therefore need to demonstrate that there is evidence showing a genuine intention to expand into the purely fashion-related goods market (ie. the category of goods which the Class 25 Dissimilar Goods belongs to).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i>Amanresorts</i></b> (at [8]-[9]), for example, the respondent adduced evidence that they had developed and marketed long-term residential accommodation known as "Aman Villas", the first of these developments being 31 Aman Villas at Amanpuri sometime around 1990. Since then, they had also worked together with various partners, developing and marketing Aman Villas at various Aman-named resorts.&nbsp; There was also evidence of "branding agreements" which had been entered into with respect to various residential projects around the world (such as Turks and Caicos Islands, Arizona, New York, Mexico and Greece). In the present case, no such evidence has been tendered before me.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Conclusion on Section 8(4)(b)(i)</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the foregoing, I find that the invalidation under the ground of Section 8(4)(b)(i) succeeds in respect of the goods in Class 18 and Class 25 Similar Goods, but not in relation to the Class 25 Dissimilar Goods.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Ground of Invalidation under Section 7(6)&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23(1) of the Act reads:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><b><span lang="EN-GB">23.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">—(1) The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid on the ground that the trade mark was registered in breach of section 7.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(6) of the Act provides that</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><b><span lang="EN-SG">7.</span></b><span lang="EN-SG">—(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in relation to bad faith is fairly settled.

The subjective element of the test means that the tribunal must ascertain what the defendant knew about the transaction or other matters in question.

The deponent, Mr Yee Kok Chew, is the Director of the Applicants ("<b>Mr Yee</b>"). Paragraphs [21] to [26] of the Applicants' SD pertained to the Applicants' dealings with a representative of the Registered Proprietors:</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">21. The Applicants' first direct encounter with the Proprietor was when I [Mr Yee] met with a representative of the Proprietor in 1992 in Singapore. I recall now that his name is "Dody". At that time Dody was promoting "EXSPORTS" bags at an Indonesian trade fair "MADE IN INDONESIA" which was held at Singapore World Trade Centre.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">22. During that time I was looking for an alternative third party manufacturer to produce the Applicants' "BODYPAC" bags.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">23. Sometime after our first meeting in Singapore, I went to Bandung to meet with Dody and to see the Proprietor's factory in Bandung. During that second meeting, I also passed to Dody about 5-6 pieces of the Applicant's "BODYPAC" bags for his quotation and sample production.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">24. Eventually, I did receive the replicated samples and quotation for manufacturing the bags. However, I considered that the quotations were too high and the quality of the replicated samples was not acceptable to me. Consequently, the parties' discussions for potential business collaborations ended there.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">25. Both parties did not return the samples to each other as it was too troublesome and additional cost was involved for shipping. Since that time, I have not met or had any contact with the Proprietor.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">26. As close to twenty (20) years have elapsed since my visit to Bandung, I am unable to locate my passport to evidence my trip to Bandung, nor any documentary evidence of the Proprietor's delivery of the bag samples and quotation to me.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their submissions, the Applicants also highlighted parts of the Applicants' SD showing that "sometime around 2005 or 2006", they had commenced legal action against one Tay Chwee Heng trading as "Orizaba" ("<b>Orizaba</b>") for having sold "BODYPACK" bags in Singapore.&nbsp; The action was subsequently discontinued because parties entered into a settlement. The court however ordered Orizaba to deliver up its inventory of "BODYPACK" bags to the Applicants.&nbsp; The Applicants submitted that the Registered Proprietors were therefore "well aware" of their rights in the Applicants' Mark – firstly, they had "seen and replicated the samples provided by the Applicants" and secondly, they had been the supplier to the Singaporean distributor (Orizaba) who had been ordered to deliver up his inventory of "BODYPACK" bags to the Applicants pursuant to a court action sometime in the year 2005 or 2006.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first limb of the test for bad faith is the subjective test of what the Registered Proprietor knew as at the date of application (i.e. 4 September 2008). Bad faith is determined as at the date of the application and matters which occurred after the date of application which may assist in determining the Registered Proprietors' state of mind as at the date of the application can be taken into consideration (see <b><i>Festina</i></b> at [101]).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Registered Proprietors are deemed to have admitted to the evidence at paragraphs [21]-[26] of the Applicants' SD, I find that it is more likely than not that the Registered Proprietors knew, through their representative, Dody, that the Applicants had goodwill in Singapore in relation to their business, through the use of the “BODYPAC” sign and the Applicants’ Mark, prior to the relevant date. The Registered Proprietors, through their representative, Dody, had received samples of goods bearing the “BODYPAC” sign and the Applicants’ Mark and had replicated these samples.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the evidence pertaining to the Applicants’ legal action against one Tay Chwee Heng (trading as Orizaba), who had stated that he obtained the offending “BODYPACK” bags from the Suit. The evidence is the Affidavit of Evidence in Chief ("<b>AEIC</b>") of Tay Chwee Heng (“<b>Tay</b>”), which is contained in an exhibit to the Applicants' SD. Again, no objections were raised to this mode of presenting evidence, and it has been deemed admitted. The AEIC includes copies of invoices for "BODYPACK" bags that Tay claimed he had bought from "PT Eigerindo MPI in Indonesia" (pp 181-193 of the Applicants' SD), whom the Applicants say are the Registered Proprietors in this case.&nbsp; These invoices show that the "buyer" of the products is "Campers' Corner", with a Singapore business address. There is other evidence in this AEIC that Tay was the Director/Secretary of Campers' Corner Outdoor Outfitters Pte Ltd (pp 227-229 of the Applicants' SD). The Registered Proprietors would at the very least be aware that they were selling goods to a third party in Singapore.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the objective element of the test for bad faith, namely, the objective test of what reasonable and experienced persons in the particular commercial area would regard as acceptable commercial behaviour, given the subjective knowledge that the Registered Proprietors had at the relevant time.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Registered Mark is different from the sign that was at issue in the Suit (pp 216-224 of the Applicants' SD, compared with the "sample pictures of the Registered Proprietors' bags" pp 269-272 of the Applicants' SD).&nbsp; In the Suit, the word "BODYPACK" is used together with other elements such as "street gear", "079", "bp (stylised device)", "#96", "it's all about style on the street."&nbsp; In the sample pictures of the Registered Proprietors' bags in this case, the bags feature the word “BODYPACK” alone, with the use of the diamond-shaped device on separate areas of the bag. The fonts used in both instances is also different. However, both the bags at issue in the Suit and the samples of bags tendered for the purposes of these proceedings feature the sign "BODYPACK", in common.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Registered Proprietors are likely to have known that the Applicants had goodwill in their business through the use of the "BODYPAC" sign or the Applicants' Mark in Singapore, I find that it would not be commercially acceptable for them to export bags for sports and/or general outdoor use to Singapore bearing a mark that uses the sign "BODYPACK", which, taken on its own, has some similarity to that of the Applicants, after the Applicants had provided samples to the Registered Proprietors' representative. The Registered Proprietors went one step further by registering their Registered Mark on 4 September 2008.&nbsp; What is especially telling is their reluctance to even defend this case, especially when such serious allegations have been made against them in the Applicants' SD (see paragraph [141] above).</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the element of bad faith has not been addressed in relation to the goods in Class 25.&nbsp; An allegation of bad faith is a serious claim to make and must be sufficiently supported by evidence: <b><i>Valentino</i></b> at [30]. Whilst the Applicants have, in their pleadings, made a passing reference to the Registered Proprietors' application in Class 25 (at paragraph 21 of their Statement of Grounds), they have not followed up on this point in their written submissions nor asked for leave to do the same in their supplementary written submissions.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of bad faith may arise in proceedings for a declaration of complete or partial invalidity of a registration under Section 47(1) of the UK Trade Marks Act, which is substantially similar to our Section 23(1) of our Act: <b><i>Kerly's (15<sup>th</sup> Ed)</i></b> at 8-290, p 277. For example, in <b><i>Mickey Dees (Nightclub) Trade Mark</i> <nobr>[1998] RPC 359</nobr></b>, it was held that the applicant for the sign "MICKEY DEES (NIGHTCLUB)" was partially invalidated in respect of "provision of nightclub services" but not in respect of "presentation of live music performances."&nbsp; In Singapore, Section 23(9) of the Act (cited above at paragraph [80]) provides that where the ground of invalidity exists in respect of only some of the goods or services, the trade mark shall be declared invalid as regards those goods and services only.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, there are insufficient particulars, submissions and evidence to support a declaration for invalidity as regards the Class 25 goods. As such, in view of the foregoing, I find that the ground of invalidation under Section 7(6) of the Act succeeds in respect of the Class 18 goods, but fails in respect of the Class 25 goods.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Overall Conclusion</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered all the pleadings and evidence filed and the submissions made in writing and orally, I find that the application for a declaration of invalidity succeeds on the grounds under Section 23(3) read with Section 8(2)(b) and 8(4)(b)(i) of the Act, in respect of the goods in Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods (defined at paragraph [68] above). I find that the application for a declaration of invalidity on the grounds of Section 23(3) read with Section 8(7)(a) and Section 23(1) read with Section 7(6) of the Act succeed in relation to the Class 18 goods only.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB">153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Registered Mark is declared invalid as regards the Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods and consequently, is deemed to have never been made, but this shall not affect transactions past and closed. The Applicants are also entitled to costs to be taxed, if not agreed.</span></p> </div><div style="text-align:center;font-family:Verdana;font-size:8.60px;"></div></content></root></maincontent></maincontent><br> <br> </div> <p><a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/Decision/89066-M.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(staywell)&amp;highlightActive=false&amp;showAnnotation=Y#anomagicid" class="goTop floatRight">Back to top</a></p> <p class="pageContentCopyright"> </p><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Government of Singapore.</p> <p></p> <!-- Content Details Body Ends --> </div><!-- Result Display Ends --> <div class="annotator-outer annotator-viewer annotator-hide">
