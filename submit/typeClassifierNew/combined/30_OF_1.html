In 1892, Mr Kintaro Hattori established a clock factory and named it "Seikosha".&nbsp; In the Japanese language, "Seiko" means "success" or "precise workmanship" and "Sha" means "house".&nbsp; Mr Hattori had in mind his goal to "succeed"in producing "precision" clocks.&nbsp; The product range gradually expanded until in 1924, the first wristwatches under the "SEIKO" brand were produced.

Since this court’s decision in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, our courts have given effect to this statutory wording by applying what is now known as the “step-by-step” approach, as opposed to the competing “global appreciation approach” applied in Europe after</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1998] RPC 199</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”). Under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round. Under the global appreciation approach the elements of similarity between marks and goods or services, whilst still necessary ingredients in the confusion inquiry, are elided with other factors going towards the ultimate question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at 223–224, and</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1999] RPC 117</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”) at 132). Whilst there have been suggestions that the two approaches might be distinct without being different, we maintain this dichotomy and endorse the step-by-step approach as being conceptually neater and more systematic and, importantly, as being more aligned with the requirements imposed under our statute (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at [8]).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed under Section 8(2)(b), the Opponents have to prove three elements, namely that the marks are similar; the goods are identical or similar; and, because of the foregoing, there is</span> a likelihood of confusion&nbsp;on the part of the public.<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; I</span>shall examine each element in turn.</font></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Similarity of Marks: Principles</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal <b><i>in Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr> ("<b><i>Sarika</i></b>") at [16] (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14932-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 2 SLR 941</a></nobr> ("<b><i>Hai Tong</i></b>") at [39]) held that:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The decided cases have established that the court will consider three aspects of similarity, <i>viz</i>, visual, aural and conceptual similarity: <i>Polo (CA)</i> at [24]; <i>Mobil Petroleum Co., Inc v Hyundai Mobis</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> at [17].&nbsp; However, it is not a pre-requisite that all three aspects of similarity must be made out before there can be a finding of similarity between the sign and the mark: <i>Mediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0496.xml&#39;)">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496</a> at [32] ("<i>Mediacorp</i>").

However, the court would not take into account “any external added matter or circumstances” because the comparison is “mark for mark” (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33], citing <em>Caterpillar Inc v Ong Eng Peng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0669.xml&#39;)">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 669</a> at [55] (“<em>Caterpillar</em>”)).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the signs/marks are considered from the viewpoint of the average consumer – <em>not</em> an unthinking person in a hurry, but rather, a person who would exercise some care and good sense in making his purchases (<em>Polo</em> at [34]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, when comparing the two signs/marks, what is relevant is the “imperfect recollection” of the customer (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33], citing <em>Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071.xml&#39;)">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071</a> at [30]).

Sun Mark Limited</i> <nobr>[2012] EWHC 29</nobr> (Ch) at [84], "BULLIT" was found likely to be misread by some as "BULLET" and vice versa; and in <i>BAKO (Trade Mark Opposition)</i> [2010] UKIntelP O-255-10 (“<b><i>Bako</i></b>”) at [42], "BAKO" and "BUKO" were also found to be visually similar to a high degree. These cases, like the present, concerned marks which differ only by one vowel.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Applicants submit that it would not be a fair assessment to dissect the marks into the separate components “SEIK-” and “I” / “O”.&nbsp; This is because consumers perceive marks as wholes.&nbsp; The Applicants cited several cases which dealt with the issue of visual similarity between short marks.&nbsp; The principle elicited from these cases is that where the word marks are short, “<i>a single letter difference can have a marked impact on visual character… The final letters are easily distinguishable and, more importantly, shape the consumer’s visual perception of the marks</i>” (<b><i>In the Matter of Application to Register the Trade Mark SPIRIT and Opposition by Spirig Pharma AG</i></b> O-138-08 at [11]); “<i>In short words, differences in the letters, even if at the end of those (short) words, are likely to stand out more. The difference is less likely to be overlooked”</i> (<b><i>In the Matter of Trade Mark Application No. 2,505,006 for Yelp (and Device) and Opposition by Yell Limited</i></b> <nobr>[2013] WL 128111</nobr> at [37]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants therefore submit that the marks “SEIKO” and “SEIKI” are visually very easy to distinguish because the two letters “O” and “I” could not be more different visually speaking. They are written using diametrically different strokes and are strikingly different, “I” being vertical and linear whereas “O” is rounded with no linear part. The visual impact of the final letter “I” in the Application Mark therefore has an impact which is not lost in the overall visual impression of the respective marks.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants point out that the marks to be compared here are not complex or composite in nature, but are merely simple, short words with an uncomplicated structure. The consumer can take in the entire mark or sign at a glance and the differences can also be noticed at one glance. Thus, as regards visual similarity, the Applicants submit that the degree of visual similarity is a very low one, confined only to the fact that the prefix portions of both the mark and the sign is the same. However, the completely different last letters “O” and “I” would not go unnoticed by the average consumer.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rebuttal, the Opponents noted that some of the marks in the cases cited by the Applicants are dictionary words, for example, “YELL” and “YELP”.&nbsp; They submit that it would be more relevant to consider cases where the marks compared were not dictionary words, such as in the case of <b><i>In the Matter of Application No. 2338998 and Opposition Thereto</i></b> O-043-06 6 February 2006 (Decision of the Appointed Person in the UK) where the marks “OKO” and “OKA”, both non-dictionary words, were found visually similar.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the parties’ submissions, I first say that reference to case authorities dealing with visual comparison of short marks is helpful, up to a limit.&nbsp; The circumstances in which each set of marks was found to be similar or not similar, to a high degree or low degree, will vary from case to case.&nbsp; However, the principles gleaned from the cases afford some guidance and could be helpful for application in different matrices, when taken with a dose of common sense in the shoes of the average consumer.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markers for visual similarity described by the High Court in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b> above are a good basic starting point. &nbsp; Thus, the Opponents have, following these markers, argued that the Application Mark is visually similar to the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks because, among other things, they are identical in length (5-letters long) and structure (comprising one word).&nbsp; As for the third marker of whether the same letters are used in the marks, it is not disputed that the first four out of the five letters between the marks (“SEIK-”) are identical.&nbsp; However, the enquiry does not stop here.&nbsp; I do not think that the High Court in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b> intended the approach in [51] of its decision to function as a fixed formula that is applied mathematically to lead to a pre-determined conclusion.That there are more letters in common than not does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the marks are therefore similar.&nbsp; At the very least, however, it is a starting point to note the points of obvious similarity.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue the inquiry, I also consider the specific features of this case, namely the short length of the competing marks and the fact that the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks comprises a Japanese word with no meaning in English.&nbsp; “SEIKO” may be considered an invented word in the English language and is therefore distinctive in the technical sense as opined at [24] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the short length of the competing marks, I am persuaded by the Applicants’ case authorities that in some instances, a single letter difference in short marks can have a marked impact on visual perception. For example, where the single-letter difference appears at the end of the marks, it may be less likely to be overlooked and more likely to stand out (as opposed to an instance where the single-letter difference occurs in the middle of the mark with identical letters on either side).&nbsp; This consideration weighs in the Applicants’ favour.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for technical distinctiveness, the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> opined at [25] that <i>“a mark which has greater technical distinctiveness enjoys a high threshold before a competing sign will be considered dissimilar to it (Sarika at [36])”.</i>&nbsp; This factor weighs in the Opponents’ favour.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of mark-similarity is more an art than a science, more of feel than of formula, though guided by principles.&nbsp; Overall, taking into account the foregoing considerations, I find that the Application Mark is visually similar to the Opponents' SEIKO Marks to a low degree.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural Similarity</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A determination of aural similarity involves, as the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> opined at [28], "<i>a qualitative assessment of the relative number of syllables which the two marks have in common</i>".&nbsp; At [30]-[31], the court also endorsed the consideration of "<i>how an average Singaporean consumer would pronounce the respective words</i>" and the making of "<i>allowances for imperfect recollection and careless pronunciation and speech</i>".</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Opponents argue that there is aural similarity because the Application Mark and the Opponents' SEIKO Marks have two syllables each, have an identical first syllable “SEI” and their second syllables both start with the same “k” sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents also drew analogies with two cases: in the <b><i>Sarika</i></b> decision at [27] to [32], the Court of Appeal held that "NUTELLA" and "NUTELLO" were aurally similar; and in <b><i>Bako</i></b> at [43], "BAKO" and "BUKO" were considered aurally similar to a high degree. These cases, like the present, concerned marks whose pronunciations differ only by a vowel.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants submit that</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the emphasis in pronunciation falls on the second syllable and not the first. i.e. “sei-<b><u>KO</u></b>” and not “<b><u>SEI</u></b>-ko”, “sei-<b><u>KI</u></b>” and not “<b><u>SEI-</u></b>ki”. This pattern of pronunciation is caused by the hard and emphatic sound required by the consonant “k” when placed after “sei”. Although both marks are two-syllable words beginning with the letters “SEI” (pronounced to rhyme with “say”), the second syllable i.e. “<b><u>KO</u></b>” (to rhyme with “koe”) and “<b><u>KI</u></b>” (to rhyme with “key”) are pronounced entirely differently. The Applicants elaborated that by definition, vowels are sounds produced with no constriction in the vocal tractas compared with consonants. The pronunciation of the vowel “i” is not likely to be mistaken for the letter “o” even if the consumer vocalizes the whole sign “SEI-KI” softly. When the marks are pronounced, the vowels at the end of each mark would not be lost as these vowels are easily articulated and make an aural impact. The “SEI” part of the words is relatively soft in comparison with the second syllables. Therefore, the Applicants conclude that it is not possible to somehow mis-hear or disregard the second syllables in this case. The normally held view that there is a tendency to slur the endings of words does not apply here, because the emphasis of the hard sound of “k” will not allow the consumer to slur the terminal endings of “SEIKO” and “SEIKI” respectively.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opined by Luxmoore LJ and cited with approval by the House of Lords in <b><i>Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld</i></b> <nobr>[1945] RPC 65</nobr>, 72, <i>"the answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another… must nearly always depend on first impression."</i></span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I accept that the competing marks are not readily susceptible to slurring at the end.&nbsp; However, while the Applicants have submitted that the emphasis in pronunciation lies in the second syllable of both marks, that is not the only way in which “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” could reasonably be pronounced in Singapore, having regard to the cultural and linguistic melting pot that is Singapore.&nbsp; The other way these marks could be pronounced entails a stress on the first, common syllable “SEI” and ends with a softer “KI”or “KO”.&nbsp; Hence, where the marks are verbalised in the latter way, the identical element is more aurally pronounced (pun unintended).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as</span> <span lang="EN-GB">a matter of "<i>first impression</i>", I find that the Application Mark is aurally similar to the Opponents' SEIKO Marks to a low degree.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptual Similarity</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of conceptual similarity, the High Court in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b> at [66] states that:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">In considering whether there is</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">conceptual</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">similarity between marks, it is necessary to consider the</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">(</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co Ltd</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0552.xml&#39;)">[2010] 4 SLR 552</a></nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Festina</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”) at [38], citing</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Bently &amp; Sherman</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at p 866).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents submit that consumers are likely to apprehend both the competing marks as foreign words.&nbsp; With imperfect recollection, the consumer would consider the marks to be conceptually similar.&nbsp; Even if consumers understand the meaning of the marks in Japanese, the Opponents claim that both “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” allude to the idea of consistent quality ("SEIKO" in the Japanese language means "success" or "precise workmanship" and "SEIKI" means "century" or "regular") and are hence conceptually similar.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants submit that the marks are conceptually neutral insofar as they would make any impression conceptually at all on the average consumer in Singapore.

Thus, the average Singaporean consumer will not have stored away in his recollection any particular connotation or impression regarding the Opponent’s SEIKO Marks.

There, the marks in question were word marks and comprised invented words, similar to the situation in the present case. The words "Mobil" and "Mobis" were invented. The PAR observed that while the applicants there argued that "Mobis" was derived from the words "mobile" and "system", it was not obvious when one sees the word "Mobis" that it meant so. He therefore concluded that no finding of conceptual similarity could be made because both the "Mobil" and the "Mobis" marks were meaningless. Similarly, following this reasoning, since the words "Nutello" and "Nutella" are invented and meaningless with no particular idea underlying each of them (and nothing has been shown in that regard) it is difficult to say that they are conceptually similar.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, both “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” are meaningless words in the English language.&nbsp; On a basic application of the principles in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> above, then, the marks are not conceptually similar.&nbsp; However, the Opponents raised an interesting point that the connotation in both marks is that they are foreign words.&nbsp; The Applicants also acknowledge this dimension by observing that both marks could be perceived as "Japanese" but were careful to submit that this in itself could not lead to the conclusion that they were conceptually similar.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am mindful that the average consumer in Singapore is not likely to know the meanings of “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” in Japanese.&nbsp; Hence, it would be unfruitful to determine whether the meanings of these words in Japanese ("century" or "regular" on the one hand and "success" or "precise workmanship" on the other) are conceptually similar.&nbsp; Second, however, these marks are not in quite the same category as the marks "Mobil" and "Mobis" referred to in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> above.&nbsp; This is because “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” are actual words in their original language, Japanese, and were conceived in Japanese, unlike "Mobil" and "Mobis".&nbsp; The average consumer in Singapore is reasonably likely to perceive them, howsoever vaguely without a sense of their meanings, as Japanese-like marks.&nbsp; Thus, while “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” are invented words in the English language, in terms of concept, the marks carry suggestions of bearing “Japanese-like characteristcs”.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can “national” characteristics ever qualify as concepts and ideas behind trade marks?&nbsp;

For example, it is foreseeable that if a mark embodies a specific Swiss-related connotation of time keeping precision, or if it carries notions of an idyllic Caribbean holiday, the mark could have a sufficiently precise concept as opposed to being conceptually meaningless.&nbsp; Even though it may be easier for such concepts to be embodied in graphical visual devices, the same could still potentially be conveyed through verbal elements in the mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, returning to the competing marks in question, I would not dismiss immediately the Opponents’ suggestion that consumers are likely to apprehend both marks as foreign words.&nbsp; However, I would probe further and seek to uncover what idea or notion is borne by this seemingly foreign quality.&nbsp; Having considered the marks “SEIKI” and “SEIKO”, I fail to see a more defined connotation in either of them.&nbsp; The conceptual suggestion of “Japanese-ness” is too nebulous in the present case.&nbsp; Being Japanese-like can mean different things to different consumers.&nbsp; To one, it could bring to mind <i>kawaii</i>, a specific quality of cuteness in Japanese culture.&nbsp; To another, it may carry allusions to Japanese restraint and resilience.&nbsp; To yet another, it may hark of futuristic concepts and robotic technology.&nbsp; In the absence of a sufficiently defined concept of being Japanese-like that is relevant and consistently perceived in the present case, I would agree with the Applicants that the marks are conceptually neutral.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I conclude that “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” are not conceptually similar.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion on Similarity of Marks</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Court of Appeal decision in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> made clear two points, among others, when concluding whether or not two marks are similar.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is no "<i>particularly or notably low threshold of marks-similarity</i>", <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [16].&nbsp;

The court must ultimately conclude <i>whether the marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</i>.&nbsp; The three aspects of similarity are meant to guide the court's inquiry but it is not helpful to convert this into a checkbox exercise in which a tick, however faint it might be, in any one box must compel the court to find that the marks are similar when a sensible appraisal of the marks as a whole would show otherwise.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">...

Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the <i>confusion</i> stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon to assess the <i>effect</i> of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers.&nbsp;

Each of these elements can vary. The marks may be identical or similar, and if the latter, they can vary in their degree of similarity.

In essence, in such proceedings, he will be required to establish that the notional fair use of his mark would not infringe the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor; whereas in infringement proceedings the only question is whether the actual use by the alleged infringer infringes the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor of the mark...</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, how the Applicants have sometimes used the Application Mark in relation to the Application Goods, as follows:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><b><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Image 2 included*]</font></b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">is but one instance of the possible normal and fair uses of the Application Mark.&nbsp; Another possible normal and fair use would be to use the Application Mark on its own without the green stylised “S” which resembles a leaf and without the tagline “Inspire the Next Generation”.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would also have regard to the notional fair use of the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks in relation to the specifications claimed in their registrations.&nbsp; It does not matter that the Opponents’ SEIKO “television watch” is no longer sold.&nbsp; It matters that their specifications include “apparatus for</span> <span lang="EN-GB">recording,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">transmission or reproduction of sound or images”, which is similar to the Application Goods.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraneous Factors</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>, the Court of Appeal also affirmed the relevance of extraneous factors <i>"to the extent they inform the court as to how the similarity of marks and goods will likely affect the consumer's perception as to the source of the goods</i>", see [83].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific types of extraneous factors that are permissible, we have guidance from the court in the conclusion at [95]-[96] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the risk of origin-based confusion is the primary interest sought to be protected by trade mark law, there must be a limit to the range of external factors that may be taken into account to determine whether a sufficient likelihood of such confusion exists.

This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers (see generally <em>Hai Tong</em> at [85(c)(i)]), and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase. We refer here to <em>In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Limited for the Registration of a Trade Mark</em> (1906) 23 RPC 774 where it was observed that, having regard to the nature of the article in question (musical instruments), the (high) price at which it was likely to be sold, and the nature of the consumers who are likely to purchase such products ("generally persons of some education"), a man of ordinary intelligence was unlikely to be confused (at 778). The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties' products. The former consideration directly impinges on the degree of care the consumer is likely to pay to his purchase and therefore his ability to detect subtle differences. As observed in <em>Reed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd</em> <nobr>[2003] RPC 12</nobr> at [103], "a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of 50,000 pounds". On the other hand, superficial price disparity between the competing goods, which speak (<i>sic</i>) more about the trader's marketing choices rather than differences in the nature of the goods themselves, is not a factor we find relevant to the inquiry.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Likelihood of Confusion: Analysis</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors Relating to the Impact of Marks-Similarity on Consumer Perception</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents submit that greater protection should be afforded to distinctive marks such as the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks.&nbsp; On the other hand, in oral submissions, the Applicants relied on</span> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc v Hyundai Mobis</span></b></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> ("</span><em><b><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></b></em><span lang="EN-GB">") and</span> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">McDonald's Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</span></b></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0177.xml&#39;)">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177</a></span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">(“</span></em><em><b><span lang="EN-GB">McDonald's</span></b></em><em><span lang="EN-GB">”)</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">for the proposition that an earlier mark’s strong reputation could have the effect of lowering the likelihood of confusion instead.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents further submit that the competing marks are closely similar, leading to a greater likelihood of confusion.&nbsp; As expected, the Applicants contend the contrary, that the marks are only similar visually and even this to a low degree.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the degree of similarity of the marks, I have held that theyare visually and aurally similar to a low degree, and not conceptually similar.&nbsp; Hence, this factor in the consideration of likelihood of confusion lies in the Applicants' favour – "<i>Clearly, the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion</i>" ([96] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>) and conversely, the lesser the similarity between the marks, the lower the likelihood of confusion.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the reputation of the earlier marks, the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> cited with approval (at [96])</span> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">Mobil</span></b></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at [74], where it was made clear that a strong reputation does not necessarily equate to a higher likelihood of confusion, and could in fact have the contrary effect as in</span> <em><b><span lang="EN-GB">McDonald's</span></b></em> <span lang="EN-GB">(see at [64]).&nbsp; In the present case, any reputation derived from the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks, especially as used on timepieces, might indeed have an effect contrary to a likelihood of confusion, as the "SEIKO" brand, no doubt with a long and established presence in Singapore, could be sufficiently entrenched in the mind of consumers as to dispel any real possibility of confusion with the Application Mark, "SEIKI".&nbsp; At this juncture it is apposite to refer to <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> where the Court of Appeal considered an argument relating to initial interest confusion.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>, the Opponents had argued that confusion which arose initially but which would have been dispelled by the time of the purchase could amount to confusion under Section 8(2) of the Act.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal considered this argument and opined at [113]:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">Having considered the relevant American, English and European authorities on the matter, our view is that the doctrine of initial interest confusion is directed at a different purpose than that of s 8(2) (and s 27(2)) of our Act.

In <b><i>Ferrero</i></b>, a 71.2% recognition rate among the survey respondents persuaded the High Court that “NUTELLA” was well known to the public at large.&nbsp; In the present case, the “SEIKO” mark has a 72% recognition rate among the survey respondents.&nbsp; At the very least, this figure shows that a substantial part of the population recognises the mark “SEIKO”.&nbsp; Given the significant sales and advertising figures in respect of the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks, and given that most people in Singapore wear watches to tell the time, a 72% recognition rate is relatively consistent with the reality check.&nbsp; However, I move on to consider other evidence adduced by the Opponents in support of their claim before coming to a conclusion whether “SEIKO” is well known to the public at large in Singapore.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature and extent of the use and advertisement of the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks in Singapore have been highlighted above at [96].&nbsp; The extensive reach of the “SEIKO” mark, in terms of entering the consciousness of the general public in Singapore, can reasonably be acknowledged.&nbsp; The Opponents’ advertisements have been exposed to the public in areas of high human traffic such as MRT stations in town and major shopping malls, among others.&nbsp; Whether in print, on bill boards, on television or through high-viewership sporting events, the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks have left an impression on the general public in Singapore.&nbsp; Their presence is hard to miss in normal daily life in Singapore, be it during a commute by bus or train, or shopping, watching sports or browsing periodicals at leisure.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mindful that the same mark “SEIKO” was not found to be well known to the public at large in an earlier IPOS decision, <b><i>Seiko Advance</i></b>.&nbsp; However, the evidence before the Principal Assistant Registrar in <b><i>Seiko Advance</i></b> could have been different from that in the present case.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in respect of the list of marks put forward by the Applicants, the appropriate conclusion to draw from the findings that Volvo, Marlboro, Victoria’s Secret, Morton’s, Calvin Klein and Kenzo were all not well known to the public at large despite being well known in Singapore, is that the evidence adduced in those cases did not suffice to discharge the burden of proof.&nbsp; In another factual matrix, it might be possible for better evidence to support a finding that one or more of such marks is well known to the public at large.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Opponents’ evidence that the well known status of the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks has been recognised in other jurisdictions, including China, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Italy, I do not think this adds very much to the Opponents’ case here.&nbsp; That the mark is well known in other jurisdictions <i>may</i> be relevant under Section 2(7)(d) of the Act, in particular “</span><i>the extent&nbsp;to which the trade mark was recognised as well known by the competent&nbsp;authorities of that country or territory</i>”.&nbsp; However, ideally, the Opponents should be able to lay out the final link from this to their proposition that “SEIKO” is well known to the public at large <i>in Singapore</i>.&nbsp; The same can be said for the Opponents’ <span lang="EN-GB">registrations for the mark “SEIKO” and its variants worldwide.&nbsp; Further, the criteria for well known marks in these jurisdictions have not been adduced in evidence before me.&nbsp; Hence, it would be difficult to rely on the state of affairs overseas to analogise that the same should be true in Singapore.&nbsp; It is also noted that Article 2(1)(c) of the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-known Marks ("the WIPO Joint Recommendation") countenances that there could be cases where the listed factors would not be relevant.&nbsp;

Sherman</i> at 885. This protection is reflective of the transition in the role of trade marks to that of “symbols” and “valuable assets in their own right” today; they are not just signals or indicators of a good’s origin. The mark identifies the good or gives it an identity, and importantly, it in <i>itself</i> attracts custom due to its “advertising” quality or selling power: <i>Bently &amp; Sherman</i> at 712.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">99 It must be shown in a dilution by blurring claim that the relevant public makes a connection or establishes a link between the sign and the trademark. As explained in <i>Citicorp</i> (at [31]), a link implies that the consumer will “call to mind” the proprietor’s well known mark after seeing the other party’s sign used in relation to that party’s goods. Whether a link is established and whether there is consequently a real and serious likelihood of damage to the distinctive character of the mark are questions to be resolved by considering all the circumstances of the case. Each case must be considered on its own facts. This so called “global” approach has been accepted in various EU decisions like that of <i>Adidas</i> (at [30]) and <i>Citicorp</i> (at [31]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there is dilution by blurring can be broken down into two elements according to the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> above, at [99].&nbsp; These are (i) “<i>whether a link is established</i>”; and (ii) “<i>whether there is consequently a real and serious likelihood of damage to the distinctive character of the mark</i>”.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng-Loy Wee Loon observes in her article “The <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> in the Anti-Dilution Right” <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Journal/79978-M.xml&#39;)">(2012) 24 SAcLJ 927</a> ("Ng-Loy's article"), at [40], that:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… Mental association is a necessary but insufficient condition to be satisfied to succeed in a blurring claim.&nbsp; To put it another way, mental association is the <i>trigger</i> and blurring is the <i>effect</i>, and this trigger does not automatically cause this effect…</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, there is much subjectivity in application of the test for dilution.&nbsp; In <b><i>Sarika</i></b>, the Court of Appeal considered the issue from multiple angles and factors.&nbsp; In particular, at [100], the Court of Appeal singled out five factors which led to a finding of dilution by blurring: (i) the degree of recognition of the earlier trade mark; (ii) the distinctive quality of the earlier trade mark given the invented nature of the word; (iii) the close similarity between the marks increasing the likelihood that the public will make a mental connection between them; (iv) the admission of the Applicants that the sign “NUTELLO” was derived from the “NUTELLA” mark and the intention was to inform consumers that the Applicants’ “NUTELLO” product was a mixture of espresso and “Nutella” chocolate cream spread; and (v) the similarity of the parties’ respective goods increasing the likelihood that consumers would draw a mental link betweenthe sign “NUTELLO” and the “NUTELLA” mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the approach of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b>, in relation to the first element of a mental link, the Opponents submit that there is such a requisite link because:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; The mark “SEIKO” is well recognised by the public at large in Singapore.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; The mark “SEIKO” is a distinctive mark and thus, it is easier to establish a link (<b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [100]). The greater its distinctiveness, the deeper it impresses upon the public consciousness, and there is therefore a greater need to protect the mark against dissociation from the products which it has been used in relation to (<b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [100]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Application Mark and the mark “SEIKO” are closely similar. This increases the likelihood that consumers will make the requisite mental link.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents further submit that given that consumers are likely to readily draw the requisite mental link, if the Application Mark is allowed to be registered for the Application Goods like televisions sets and disc players, its extended use will create a real and serious likelihood of weakening the identity of the mark “SEIKO” for watches. The mark “SEIKO” may no longer have the capacity to conjure an immediate association with its watches.&nbsp; Thus, the second element outlined by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> is also satisfied.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ng-Loy's article, the author expressed concern with the multifactorial approach taken in the US.&nbsp; There, under the current §43(c)(2)(B) of the Lanham Act (1946), a statutory non-exhaustive list of factors guide the inquiry for blurring.&nbsp; The factors on that list appear to overlap with the factors considered by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [100].&nbsp; The three factors in the Opponents’ submissions at [118] are all found on this list as well.&nbsp; Hence, I think it pertinent to consider the learned author’s commentary on some of such factors.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the degree of recognition and distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark (as relied on by the Opponents in submissions), Ng-Loy observes at [43] that these factors:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… go towards establishing the level of recognition or distinctiveness of the senior mark.&nbsp; Pegging the level of distinctiveness of the senior mark is necessary because the statutory anti-dilution right is available only to marks that are “widely recognised by the general consuming public of the US” (or in the case of Singapore, to trade marks that are “well known to the public at large in Singapore”).&nbsp; This very high level of renown or distinctiveness is the subject matter of protection of the anti-blurring right.&nbsp; The blurring inquiry is to determine if there would be a reduction or loss of this distinctiveness.&nbsp; If so, it is not clear how the level of distinctiveness of the senior mark (the very subject matter of protection) can inform on whether there would be harm to the subject matter.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author also comments on the multifactorial approach, which appears similar to the "global" approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [99] and by the Opponents in the present case, from a public policy angle, at [44]:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The other criticism about adopting this multifactorial approach in the blurring inquiry is the uncertainty it generates.&nbsp; Uncertainty breeds conservatism, especially on the part of the defendant who is in a face-off with a mega brand owner with deep pockets.&nbsp; SMEs trying to break into a market dominated by a mega brand owner will feel pressured to back down if all that their lawyers can tell them with certainty is that “it all depends on the facts”…</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving these concerns aside for the time, I endeavour to apply the multifactorial, "global" approach in accordance with <b><i>Sarika</i></b> at [99] to [100].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that the degree of recognition of the earlier trade mark, "SEIKO", is relatively high.&nbsp; I have also found earlier that the Opponents' SEIKO Marks have arelatively high degree of distinctiveness.&nbsp; These would be factors in the Opponents' favour.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on in the inquiry under Section 8(2)(b), I have found that the competing marks are visually and aurally similar to a low degree but not conceptually similar.&nbsp; Overall in the balance, I concluded that the Application Mark and the Opponents' SEIKO Marks "<i>when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</i>", but only marginally.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for possible admission, the Applicants here did not admit to any intended association between the Application Mark and the Opponents' SEIKO Marks, unlike the defendants in <b><i>Sarika</i></b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> also considered the degree of similarity of the parties' respective goods, which would increase the likelihood that consumers would draw a mental link between the two marks.&nbsp; In the present case, comparing the Application Goods with the Opponents’ goods for which they are well known under the “SEIKO” mark, being timepieces, it would be a stretch to say that electronic goods such as television sets and disc players are so similar to timepieces that “<i>it would be extremely likely for consumers to draw a mental link</i>” between the Application Mark, “SEIKI”, and the well known mark “SEIKO”.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, having taken the multifactorial, "global" approach, I find that the Opponents have not discharged their burden of proof to show that dilution would occur.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inquiry under Section 8(4)(ii)(A) effectively ends here, but it is of interest, and perhaps of some help in developing jurisprudence for the future, to consider the suggestion in Ng-Loy’s article.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng-Loy’s article proposes, at [44], a new formula to be used in the blurring inquiry:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… There are two stages in this new formula.&nbsp; The first stage contains one condition to be satisfied, namely, the proprietor of the senior mark is known to be engaged in substantially one field of activity.&nbsp; If this condition is not satisfied, blurring cannot occur and this marks the end of the blurring inquiry.&nbsp; On the other hand, if this condition is satisfied, it does not automatically follow that blurring would occur.&nbsp; The inquiry has to move on to the second stage where consideration is given to the degree of similarity between the junior mark and the senior mark.&nbsp; This factor impacts on the blurring inquiry in this way: the higher the degree of similarity, the greater the risk of blurring occurring, and in the case where the marks are identical or substantially identical, there is a presumption that blurring would occur.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the alternative approach proposed above, one first considers whether the proprietor of the senior mark is known to be engaged in substantially one field of activity.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants canvassed an interesting argument at the hearing, which I will describe at this juncture.&nbsp; The Applicants submit that the Opponents themselves are diluting the mark “SEIKO”.&nbsp; The evidence shows that the Opponents are known for timepieces, but the Opponents’ own evidence also shows that their SEIKO Marks are used in relation to golf clubs, spectacle lens and frames, industrial equipment, musical tuners, printing machines (under the mark “SEIKO EPSON”) and so on.&nbsp; The Opponents have trade mark registrations in 12 classes, and have diverse business interests in all these fields.&nbsp; The Applicants conclude that it would be very difficult for the Opponents to claim there is dilution if there is not a single field of business using the mark “SEIKO”, but many fields, particularly if the public is not aware that all these undertakings are related.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is apposite to delve more deeply into the reason for the first step of the alternative approach.&nbsp; This is articulated at [45] of Ng-Loy’s article as follows:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The condition that the proprietor of the senior mark is known to be engaged in substantially one field of activity is derived from factor (c) of the US list. In my view, this factor is so critical in the blurring inquiry that it should be elevated to the status of a condition that must be satisfied.&nbsp; To illustrate why it is critical that the senior mark must be used in substantially one field of activity, the NTUC mark – which belongs to the National Trade Union Congress (“NTUC”), the trade union in Singapore that is also involved in commercial activities – will be used.&nbsp; The NTUC mark is a mark that has acquired the status of a household name in Singapore as the brand for a chain of supermarkets.&nbsp; However, it is also well known amongst the general public in Singapore that the NTUC organisation is involved in other businesses such as insurance, dental care and childcare, and the NTUC mark is used to promote these businesses.&nbsp; If the public is asked today what comes to mind at the mention of the NTUC mark, the response would be: “Supermarkets, insurance and childcare.”&nbsp; If there is unauthorised use of the NTUC mark in certain other fields of activity, such as the medical sector, it is far more likely to cause the public to wonder if the unauthorised goods or services are a further diversification of the business activities of the NTUC organisation – in which case, the effect of the mental association is not blurring, but confusion.&nbsp; The remedy for the proprietor of the senior mark lies in traditional confusion-based protection…</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the Applicants’ argument, one may at first thought accept that the mark “SEIKO”, with its wide range of application on goods as varied as timepieces, golf clubs and spectacle frames and lenses, is already being diluted by the Opponents themselves.&nbsp; They can hardly then point the finger of accusation at another trader for using a junior mark “SEIKI” on television sets and disc players.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, and this goes back to the first stage in the alternative approach – that the senior mark must be known to be engaged in substantially one field of activity – it is not widely known to the general public that the mark “SEIKO” is not only used by the same business group in relation to timepieces, but also in relation to a variety of other goods.&nbsp; This is quite unlike the example of NTUC cited in Ng-Loy’s article, which is known to the public in several fields including supermarkets, insurance and childcare.&nbsp; As such, I do not think the fact that the Opponents’ business group uses the mark “SEIKO” in diverse fields other than horology and chronometry and on a wide range of goods precludes the possibility of blurring.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng-Loy’s article also explains at [45] to [46] as follows:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… There is one more point to note about this condition.&nbsp; The condition is that the senior mark is <i>known</i> to be used in substantially one field of activity.&nbsp; If the senior mark is, in fact, used in another field of activity, but this fact is not widely known, it does not preclude blurring from occurring.&nbsp; The ROLLS-ROYCE mark is an example on point.&nbsp; Apart from the automobile industry, the ROLLS-ROYCE mark is, in fact, used in the civil and defence aerospace sector…</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… Although the ROLLS-ROYCE mark is used in the automobile industry and in the aerospace industry, the latter is not a well-known fact and therefore the public’s response to the ROLLS-ROYCE mark would only be “cars”.&nbsp; It is because of this unique meaning of the ROLLS-ROYCE mark that the public cannot imagine the Rolls-Royce car company moving outside of the automobile industry.&nbsp; Hence the difficulty to prove confusion when there is an unauthorised use of this mark in relation to goods or services that are not car-related.&nbsp; Thus it is suggested that Schechter’s example can still serve as the <i>locus classicus</i> of blurring.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in relation to the first stage of the alternative approach, the senior mark “SEIKO” is indeed known to be engaged in substantially one field of activity.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second stage, one considers whether the degree of similarity between the junior mark and the senior mark is sufficiently high for blurring to occur.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ng-Loy’s article explains, at [47], why a high degree of similarity between the junior mark and the senior mark is necessary:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… The relevance of this factor to the blurring inquiry is obvious.&nbsp; Since blurring is the risk that the “one mark one product” response will turn into a “one mark two products” response, this risk is higher if the mental association that the consumers make between the junior mark and the senior mark is a very strong and immediate one.&nbsp; The greater the degree of similarity between the two marks, the stronger and more immediate the mental association… In Singapore, it would also be impossible to impose a condition that the marks must be identical or near identical.&nbsp; This is because the anti-dilution provision accepts that it is sufficient if the junior mark is “identical with or <i>similar</i> to” the senior mark.&nbsp; However, this does not preclude a tribunal from giving <i>more weight</i> to the factor of identity between marks.&nbsp; It is suggested that the tribunal should, in fact, treat the identity or near-identity of marks as creating a rebuttable presumption that blurring will occur in circumstances where the senior mark is used in substantially one field of activity.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thus mindful that there is no legislative requirement that the senior and junior marks must be identical or near identical.&nbsp; However, giving <i>more weight</i> to the degree of similarity between the marks, the conclusion would be that there is no reasonable likelihood of blurring because the Application Mark and the Opponents’ SEIKO Marks were found to be only marginally similar, visually and aurally.&nbsp; One is reminded that a mental association between the marks in itself is not sufficient.&nbsp; Such mental association must lead to dilution, in this case, by blurring, before the ground can be made out.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the same conclusion is reached under the Court of Appeal’s approach in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> and under the alternative two-stage approach suggested by Ng-Loy.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there dilution “in an unfair manner”?</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have found that there is no dilution by blurring, there is no necessity to consider if such blurring is “<i>in an unfair manner</i>”.&nbsp; However, the Opponents made a point in their oral submissions that dilution in an unfair manner is treated as a whole by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The Opponents remarked that it waspreposterous to say there could be dilution in a fair manner.&nbsp; I would take the opportunity to address the latter point here.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4(1)(b)(ii) of the WIPO Joint Recommendation is the inspiration for the legislative language in Section 55 and Section 8(4) of the Act.&nbsp; The relevant section of Article 4(1)(b)(ii) of the WIPO Joint Recommendation provides guidance on what is meant by dilution “in an unfair manner” as follows:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… The meaning of the words “in an unfair manner” implies that third-party use of a well known mark which is not <i>contrary to honest commercial practice</i> (e.g. reference to a well known mark for review or parody) does not constitute dilution.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents’ suggestion could not have been the legislative intent behind the provision, which would otherwise render the phrase “<i>in an unfair manner”</i> superfluous.&nbsp; The proper interpretation and application of the phrase is illustrated by the Principal Assistant Registrar’s decision in <b><i>Doctor’s Associates Inc v Sim Meng Seh</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/74704-M.xml&#39;)">[2011] SGIPOS 15</a></nobr> (“<b><i>Subway</i></b>”).&nbsp; Although the Opponents’ trade mark “SUBWAY” was not found to be well known to the public at large, the Principal Assistant Registrar went on to consider whether there was blurring, and if so, whether this was in an unfair manner.&nbsp; Being persuaded that there would be dilution by blurring, she nevertheless was unable to find that the Applicants’ continued use of the application mark in that</font> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">case, to which goodwill has attached since 1988, before the Opponents entered the Singapore market, has caused dilution “<i>in an unfair manner”</i>, <b><i>Subway</i></b> at [49].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I cannot agree with the Opponents’ interpretation of the phrase “<i>in an unfair manner”</i>.&nbsp; While the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> did not specifically consider whether the dilution there was caused “<i>in an unfair manner”</i>, this was not a point raised by the defendant either.&nbsp; Hence, the Court of Appeal may not have had the full opportunity to consider arguments whether the dilution of “NUTELLO” was caused “<i>in an unfair manner”</i>.&nbsp; It should therefore not be construed, as the Opponents sought to, that the Court of Appeal has definitively treated the requirement “<i>cause dilution in an unfair manner</i>” as a whole rather than as two distinct elements.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that Ng-Loy, in her article cited above at [116], has thoughtfully suggested an approach to the fairness-unfairness inquiry by reference to the statutory defences found in Sections 55(6), 55(7) and 55A of the Act.&nbsp; These could serve as checkpoints and present refutable or irrefutable presumptions that certain uses are fair, as the case may be.
