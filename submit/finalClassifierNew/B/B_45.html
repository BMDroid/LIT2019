A director of the plaintiff, Mr&nbsp;Lim, and the defendant, Mr&nbsp;Shiok, met in late 2004. On 9&nbsp;December 2004 they entered into a tenancy agreement (“the first tenancy agreement”) for the unit. The term was for two years (1&nbsp;January 2005 to 31&nbsp;December 2006). Rent was fixed at $3,200 a month. Clause 3(d) provided that during the term of the tenancy, the landlord “agrees not to sell [the unit] to any purchasers other than [Mr&nbsp;Shiok]” at a predetermined price.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">After signing the first tenancy agreement, Mr&nbsp;Shiok proceeded to renovate the unit. The contractor was Heng Loong Construction (“Heng Loong”), where Mr&nbsp;Lim was a partner. The renovation took six months, <em>ie</em>, a quarter of the term of the tenancy, and cost over $100,000, <em>ie</em>, over thirty times the monthly rent. The work done included the construction of a mezzanine floor which effectively doubled the floor area of the unit. The court found that Mr&nbsp;Lim had to have represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok during their first meeting that a mezzanine floor could be built and he would obtain the necessary approvals. Once the renovation was complete Mr&nbsp;Shiok began operating his business from the unit. Mr&nbsp;Shiok also obtained a valuation to determine the unit’s open market value for financing purposes.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">Mr&nbsp;Shiok claimed that he always evinced an intention to purchase the unit after he entered into the first tenancy agreement. In any event, Mr&nbsp;Shiok signed an agreement (“the second tenancy agreement”) which renewed the first tenancy agreement for two more years at the same rent. Mr&nbsp;Shiok claimed he was forced to renew the first tenancy agreement under duress from Mr&nbsp;Lim, though he also said that he accepted the renewal as a substitute for an outright purchase.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">The mezzanine floor turned out to be irregular and the plaintiff obtained a court order to enter into the unit to remove it. The removal of the mezzanine floor impaired Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s business, and he was unable to pay rent. The formal term of the second tenancy agreement ended in the meantime, and in the present action the plaintiff sought to recover possession, arrears in rent and double rent for holding over. Mr&nbsp;Shiok resisted on the ground that (a)&nbsp;he had a right under cl&nbsp;3(d) of the first tenancy agreement to purchase the unit, and (b)&nbsp;a proprietary estoppel was raised against the plaintiff.</p> <p class="HN-Heading">Held, finding that a proprietary estoppel was raised against the plaintiff and ordering damages to be assessed to satisfy the <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span>:</p> <p class="HN-Held">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its face, cl&nbsp;3(d) only granted a right of pre-emption, and there was no way in which its words could have been construed as amounting to the grant of an option. However, Mr&nbsp;Lim’s evidence strongly indicated that the parties’ understanding was that an option to purchase was granted. This was fortified by the fact that Mr&nbsp;Shiok spent substantial time and money renovating the unit – it was very doubtful that he would have done so if there was not some understanding between the parties that he could purchase the unit. On this basis, the court would have granted rectification of cl&nbsp;3(d) but for the fact that both Mr&nbsp;Shiok and Mr&nbsp;Lim also seemed to accept that cl&nbsp;3(d) correctly captured the contractual agreement between them. In the absence of a mistake as to the language used, rectification was not possible: at&nbsp;<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_26">[26]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique feature of this case was that the proprietary estoppel was said to exist alongside formal contractual arrangements, <em>viz</em>, the two tenancy agreements. As a matter of principle, proprietary estoppel is not necessarily precluded by the existence of a formal contract between the parties, whether the contract was entered into prior to, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the representation which was said to have given rise to the estoppel. The overarching inquiry remains whether, in particular individual circumstances, it would be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that which, knowingly, or unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume to his detriment: at&nbsp;<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_28">[28]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, Mr&nbsp;Lim had to have represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok, at the time the first tenancy agreement was signed, that he could buy the unit at some point in time. Otherwise Mr&nbsp;Shiok would not have invested so much into the unit. The renovation by Heng Loong alone cost over $100,000 and took six months. This could not have been justified on the formal terms of the first tenancy agreement which lasted two years and for which Mr&nbsp;Shiok was willing to pay $3,200 a month. For the same reason, the representation could not be intended to be subsumed within the first agreement. And, in material and detrimental reliance on the representation, Mr&nbsp;Shiok entered into the first tenancy agreement, renovated the unit and built the mezzanine floor. In the circumstances, a proprietary estoppel was raised against the plaintiff: at&nbsp;<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_29">[29]</a> and <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_30">[30]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second tenancy agreement, the court found that, in entering the agreement, Mr&nbsp;Shiok felt constrained to some extent by the investment he already put into the unit.

The defendant was the tenant of the unit under two successive tenancy agreements. The formal terms of both leases have run out. In this action, the plaintiff is claiming for the repossession of the unit, arrears in rent and double rent for holding over. The defendant is resisting the claim on the basis that he is entitled to purchase the unit pursuant to a contractual right or proprietary estoppel. There is also the issue of who should bear the responsibility for the construction of a mezzanine floor in the unit which is irregular under planning regulations.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff was represented by instructed counsel, Mr&nbsp;Thio Shen Yi&nbsp;SC. Its sole witness was Mr&nbsp;Lim Chin Leong, the plaintiff’s managing director. The defendant, Mr&nbsp;Shiok, appeared in person. He gave evidence himself and also called Mr&nbsp;Yeo Hock Chuan who is a property agent who acted for him in his initial dealings with the plaintiff.

On 9&nbsp;December 2004 they entered into a tenancy agreement for the unit (“the first tenancy agreement”). The term was for two years, from 1&nbsp;January 2005 to 31&nbsp;December 2006. Rent was fixed at $3,200 a month. Clause&nbsp;3(d) of the first tenancy agreement read:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the term of the Tenancy, THE LANDLORD agrees not to sell THE SAID PREMISES to any purchasers other than THE TENANT at the predetermined sale price of <b>Singapore Dollars Four Hundred Sixty Two Thousand And Fifty Four Only (S$462,054.00) or at S$159.00 per sqft</b>, exclusive of GST and stamp duty which are payable by THE TENANT.

While the right was subsisting, the Plaintiffs were not allowed to sell the Premises to anybody except the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1">It is pertinent to note that Mr&nbsp;Lim, rather artfully, stopped shy of saying that <em>he</em> understood cl&nbsp;3(d) to be a right of pre-emption. Mr&nbsp;Lim’s evidence on the stand, when he was cross-examined by Mr&nbsp;Shiok, was significantly different. On the second day of the trial, there was this exchange:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">During [our first meeting in December 2004], we conclude the rental of the unit&nbsp;05-11 and the option to purchase the unit at $159 per square feet.

[Moves on.]</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Shiok and Mr&nbsp;Yeo were also cross-examined on the meaning of cl&nbsp;3(d). Unsurprisingly, they confirmed that it was a right of pre-emption. However, they were not examined on the actual understanding reached between themselves. This is an issue which was obviously relevant because of Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s insistence that he had an option and Mr&nbsp;Lim’s repeated agreement on the stand with Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s point that an option was in fact the true arrangement between them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Renovations and the construction of the mezzanine floor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After signing the first tenancy agreement, Mr&nbsp;Shiok proceeded to renovate the unit. The renovation took five to six months. The contractor was Heng Loong Construction (“Heng Loong”), of which Mr&nbsp;Lim was a partner. The invoices issued by Heng Loong to Mr&nbsp;Shiok totalled $106,176.63. The work done included the construction of a mezzanine floor which effectively doubled the floor area of the unit. After the renovations were completed, Mr&nbsp;Shiok began operating his business from the unit. He ran a precision engineering business and his plant included heavy machinery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mezzanine floor turned out to be irregular and has since been removed pursuant to an order of Judith Prakash&nbsp;J. The issue is who should be responsible for the irregularity. The irregularity, which was pointed out to the plaintiff by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) on 18&nbsp;December 2006 and by the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) on 25&nbsp;January 2007, seemed to arise from the fact that the mezzanine floor area caused the gross floor area of the building to exceed the permitted limit. The precise nature of the irregularity was not clearly explained by either party. But both parties agreed on the fact of the irregularity and it is sufficient for present purposes to proceed on that basis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC at&nbsp;[9], Mr&nbsp;Shiok deposed that Mr&nbsp;Lim represented to him during their first meeting that the floor area of the unit could be expanded by constructing a mezzanine floor. At&nbsp;[10], Mr&nbsp;Shiok went on to say that Mr&nbsp;Lim represented to him that “they” would do all the relevant work and take care of obtaining the relevant approvals, <em>etc</em>, from the relevant government bodies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC, Mr&nbsp;Yeo Hock Chuan, who was Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s property agent at the time of the first tenancy agreement, deposed that Mr&nbsp;Lim had represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok that the floor area of the unit could be expanded by the construction of a mezzanine floor, and that Mr&nbsp;Lim could carry out the construction and attend to all approval requirements. He also said that Mr&nbsp;Lim showed Mr&nbsp;Shiok a room where Mr&nbsp;Lim already built a mezzanine floor and told Mr&nbsp;Shiok he could do the same. According to Mr&nbsp;Yeo, all this happened in his presence. During cross-examination, Mr&nbsp;Yeo conceded that he did not hear Mr&nbsp;Lim represent to Mr&nbsp;Shiok that approval of the mezzanine was guaranteed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC at&nbsp;[7]–[8], Mr&nbsp;Lim deposed that the plaintiff was prepared to allow Mr&nbsp;Shiok to construct the mezzanine floor, but did not warrant that the structure was or would be approved. At&nbsp;[28], Mr&nbsp;Lim elaborated that neither the plaintiff nor Heng Loong nor himself had ever represented, warranted, promised or agreed that the said works could be used by Mr&nbsp;Shiok as a mezzanine floor – any risk of illegality was assumed solely by Mr&nbsp;Shiok.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr&nbsp;Lim took varying positions in cross-examination. At first, he said that, as of November 2004 and for six months thereafter, nobody knew what a mezzanine floor was - it was only in April 2007 that the BCA raised the issue with the developer and the proprietors. Shortly after, however, Mr&nbsp;Lim said that, during the same period, all the proprietors of the building, including Mr&nbsp;Shiok, knew that a mezzanine floor was not allowed. A while later, when confronted with a police report by another proprietor that he was misled as to the legality of building a mezzanine floor, Mr&nbsp;Lim said that he could write off the report, as well as other similar reports by other proprietors, because he had told them that a mezzanine floor was illegal. Finally, when confronted with an invoice dated 1&nbsp;June 2005 which expressly referred to “Partition Work at Mezzanine”, Mr&nbsp;Lim said that the building of mezzanine floors was rampant at that time; he did the work at Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s request; and the issue was not what he knew or did not know. Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s various and varying positions contradict each other. If no one knew what a mezzanine floor was, they would not have known or been told that it was not allowed. If it was not allowed and they knew that, then why was Mr&nbsp;Lim building a mezzanine floor for Mr&nbsp;Shiok through Heng Loong?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also pertinent to refer to the following letter dated 27&nbsp;November 2006 from 3P&nbsp;Architects to the URA on behalf of the plaintiff, where the following passage is found:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would like to seek your advice on payment of differential premium that may be leviable by Commissioner of Lands if we are proposing to increase the gross floor area to 11,602.59&nbsp;sq&nbsp;m where the plot ratio will be 2.022 exceeding the allowable GPR of 2.00.</p> <p class="Judg-1">It was only after the URA refused permission that the plaintiff wrote to the relevant proprietors, including Mr&nbsp;Shiok, to remove their mezzanine floors. Prior to that, there is no evidence of the plaintiff giving any kind of warning to the proprietors. This application by 3P Architects on behalf of the plaintiff is consistent with the plaintiff having represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok that he could build a mezzanine floor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, therefore, I believe Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s story in this regard. I find that, during their first meeting, Mr&nbsp;Lim must have told Mr&nbsp;Shiok that a mezzanine floor could be built and that he would apply for the necessary approvals for the mezzanine floor. There is also no evidence that Mr&nbsp;Lim warned Mr&nbsp;Shiok that a mezzanine floor would be irregular until approved. Since Heng Loong had not entered the picture at this point, these representations must have been made on behalf of the plaintiff. I also find that these representations must have materially induced Mr&nbsp;Shiok into entering into the first tenancy agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Valuation report</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, Mr&nbsp;Shiok also obtained a valuation report from Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd. The report was dated October 2005. The purpose of the report, as stated therein, was “[t]o determine the open market value of the subject property for financing purposes”. The report determined that the open market value of the unit was $470,000. It noted that the mezzanine floor had not been approved, and therefore excluded it from consideration. It is pertinent to note that the report was given <em>after</em> the renovation works were completed. Thus it cannot be evidence that Mr&nbsp;Shiok proceeded with the construction of the mezzanine floor knowing that it was irregular.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The transition to the second tenancy agreement</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Shiok deposed in his AEIC at&nbsp;[29]–[32] that, after he entered into the first tenancy agreement, he always evinced an intention to purchase the unit. He also deposed that his intention was communicated clearly and unambiguously to the plaintiff. However, he conceded in cross-examination that his alleged intention to buy the unit was never expressed in writing. The earliest document where such an intention was recorded was dated 28&nbsp;August 2008, when the parties’ relationship had already become acrimonious.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the documentary evidence went, there was a letter dated 10&nbsp;October 2006 by the plaintiff asking Mr&nbsp;Shiok to confirm with the plaintiff by 16&nbsp;November 2006 whether he wished to renew the tenancy for another two years at a monthly rent of $3,680. On 27&nbsp;November 2006, Mr&nbsp;Shiok replied to request the then-existing rate of rent, $3,200, to remain if he renewed the tenancy.

The term began retrospectively from 1&nbsp;January 2007 and continued to 31&nbsp;December 2008. The rent remained at $3,200 a month. Clause&nbsp;2(f)(iii) of the second tenancy agreement provided that Mr&nbsp;Shiok shall:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the currency of this tenancy, to allow the Landlord or its representatives at all reasonable times to bring any interested parties to view the said premises in the event of a prospective sale thereof. The said premises shall be sold subject to this tenancy.</p> <p class="Judg-1">Clause&nbsp;4(i) of the second tenancy agreement provided that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the term of the Tenancy, THE LANDLORD agrees not to sell THE SAID PREMISES to any purchasers other than THE TENANT at the sale price which will be determined after the CSC.</p> <p class="Judg-1">While it is not relevant to any issue before me, I note that the plaintiff appeared to have dated its copy of the second tenancy agreement unilaterally as Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s copy is undated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his AEIC, Mr&nbsp;Lim deposed that cl&nbsp;4(i) of the second tenancy agreement (which he also characterised as a right of pre-emption) differed from cl&nbsp;3(d) of the first tenancy agreement because of worries that the issues surrounding the construction of the mezzanine floor will delay the application for the Certificate of Statutory Completion (“the CSC”) and render the plaintiff liable for liquidated damages to a purchaser.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant to note that Mr&nbsp;Lim claimed that this worry arose on or before November 2006 when the application for the CSC was submitted. This was materially different from his evidence in cross-examination that he only knew about the mezzanine floor in April 2007 (see <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_11">[11]</a> above). It is also pertinent to note that Mr&nbsp;Lim’s explanation is not congruent with his position in his AEIC that there was only a right of pre-emption between the parties – if this was so, whether or not the unit was sold would be entirely in the power of the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his part, Mr&nbsp;Shiok claimed that he entered into the second tenancy agreement because he had no choice:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="17%"><col width="83%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"> <p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Court:</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"> <p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">… Let me ask you a simple question.

Mr&nbsp;Shiok refused to remove the mezzanine floor and to pay rent. The plaintiff sought to evict him and remove the mezzanine floor. As mentioned (see <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_7">[7]</a> above), Judith Prakash&nbsp;J allowed the plaintiff to remove the mezzanine floor, and this was accomplished on 29–30&nbsp;January 2010. Mr&nbsp;Shiok was very badly affected by this turn of events. The conduct of his business was substantially impaired with the demolition of the mezzanine floor and has now ceased. He is now in poor financial straits and is facing bankruptcy. During the trial, he was visibly stirred when he cross-examined Mr&nbsp;Lim, and clearly felt himself to have been victimised. In fact, he had to be hospitalised after the second day of the trial, which caused the trial to be delayed for three&nbsp;months.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal terms of both tenancy agreements have ended. Hence, unless Mr&nbsp;Shiok is able to establish some other right to possession of the unit, he must surrender possession to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contract</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s first argument was founded on contract – specifically, that he had a contractual option to purchase pursuant to cl&nbsp;3(d) of the first tenancy agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its face, cl&nbsp;3(d) only granted a right of pre-emption. For present purposes that is significantly different from an option to purchase because the plaintiff has not made any offer to sell the unit. There was no way in which the words in cl&nbsp;3(d) could have been construed as amounting to the grant of an option. However, Mr&nbsp;Lim’s evidence on the stand strongly indicated that the parties’ understanding was that an option to purchase was granted. This is fortified by the fact that Mr&nbsp;Shiok spent six&nbsp;months and over $100,000 for Heng Loong to renovate the unit. This amounted to a quarter of the term of the first tenancy agreement and over thirty&nbsp;times the monthly rent, and it is very doubtful that he would have done so if there was not some understanding between the parties that he could purchase the unit. On this basis, I would have granted rectification of cl&nbsp;3(d) but for the fact that both Mr&nbsp;Shiok and Mr&nbsp;Lim also seem to accept, rather confusingly, that cl&nbsp;3(d) correctly captured the contractual agreement between them. In the absence of a mistake as to the language used, rectification is not possible.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proprietary estoppel</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s next argument was proprietary estoppel. For present purposes, the general elements of proprietary estoppel are sufficiently stated by Sundaresh Menon&nbsp;JC in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0292.xml&#39;)">[2007] 1&nbsp;SLR(R) 292</a> at&nbsp;[170]: there must be a representation concerning a right or interest in land by the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be raised, and reliance and detriment on the part of the party seeking to raise the estoppel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique feature of this case is that the proprietary estoppel is said to exist <em>alongside</em> formal contractual arrangements, <em>viz</em>, the two tenancy agreements. As a matter of principle, I do not think that proprietary estoppel is necessarily precluded by the existence of a formal contract between the parties, whether the contract was entered into prior to, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the representation which is said to have given rise to the estoppel. Of course, the existence of a formal contract is an important fact to be considered in determining whether an estoppel has arisen. For example, a prior or contemporaneous contract may give rise to an inference that the representation which was not reduced into contract was not, when objectively viewed, intended to be relied upon. A subsequent contract, where the parties redefine their previously informal relationship, may lead to the conclusion that the <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span> raised by the estoppel has been displaced by the subsequent agreement of the parties. There are other possibilities, and everything depends on the facts of each case. The overarching inquiry remains, as Oliver&nbsp;J put it in his influential restatement in <em>Taylors Fashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67598-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67598-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1982]&nbsp;QB&nbsp;133</a> at&nbsp;151–152, “whether, in particular individual circumstances, it would be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that which, knowingly, or unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume to his detriment”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evidence, I find that Mr&nbsp;Lim must have represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok, at the time the first tenancy agreement was signed, that he could buy the unit at some point in time. Otherwise Mr&nbsp;Shiok would not have invested so much into the unit. The renovation by Heng Loong alone cost over $100,000 and took six months. This expenditure in terms of money and time could not have been justified on the formal terms of the first tenancy agreement which lasted two years and for which Mr&nbsp;Shiok was willing to pay $3,200 a month. For the same reason, I find that the representation cannot be intended to be subsumed <em>within</em> the first agreement. In particular, the first tenancy agreement’s duration of two&nbsp;years shows that it must have existed as an understanding between the parties <em>alongside</em> their contractual arrangements. I find additional support for this conclusion in the note scribbled by Mr&nbsp;Lim on Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s letter of 27&nbsp;November 2006 (see <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_16">[16]</a> above), stating that a sale might be delayed to September 2007 pending the issuance of the CSC. The note may well be an internal note, as Mr&nbsp;Lim claimed. However, its existence indicated that the possibility of a sale to Mr&nbsp;Shiok, albeit outside the terms of the first tenancy agreement, was very much on the mind of Mr&nbsp;Lim. Otherwise, there seemed no reason why the note would be scribbled on Mr&nbsp;Lim’s letter, as opposed to some other place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore find, on the basis of the parties’ dealings during the first tenancy agreement, that Mr&nbsp;Lim had represented to Mr&nbsp;Shiok that he could buy the unit. And in material and detrimental reliance thereon, Mr&nbsp;Shiok entered into the first tenancy agreement, renovated the unit and built the mezzanine floor. Admittedly, the <em>precise</em> terms of the representation cannot be established on the evidence before me. But that in itself is not a problem given that I am satisfied that some representation must have been made. The <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span> arising from proprietary estoppel “need not fail merely on the ground that the interest to be secured has not been expressly indicated”: <em>Plimmer v The Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of the City of Wellington</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/30761-E-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/30761-E-M.xml&#39;)">(1884) 9&nbsp;App Cas&nbsp;699</a> at&nbsp;713. Given my findings, and since Mr&nbsp;Lim was acting on behalf of the plaintiff, a proprietary estoppel was therefore raised against the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is the effect of the second tenancy agreement and the events surrounding it. Here the evidence is rather sketchy and inconclusive. As mentioned, there is no documentary evidence that Mr&nbsp;Shiok attempted to buy the unit. On the other hand, it appears that some parts of the parties’ dealings were undocumented or at least not presented to the court. For example, there is no documentary evidence supporting Mr&nbsp;Lim’s testimony that an option was presented at some point in time to Mr&nbsp;Shiok. There is also no evidence with respect to the parties’ discussions on the second tenancy agreement. As for the second tenancy agreement, I do not think that Mr&nbsp;Shiok was compelled by economic duress to enter into it such that it could be set aside. As mentioned (see <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2011]%201%20SLR%200433.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(equity)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_22">[22]</a> above), Mr&nbsp;Shiok showed that he was willing to accept the second tenancy agreement as a substitute for an outright purchase. Also, as Mr&nbsp;Thio pointed out, duress was not pleaded. At the same time, however, it seemed clear that entering into the agreement was not a clear cut decision for both parties, given the three month delay between the expiry of the first tenancy agreement in December 2006 and the signing of the second tenancy agreement in March 2007. I do not think that the difficulties which must have been faced by the parties in negotiating a new agreement were entirely attributable to Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s failure to pay rent in December 2006 , January and February 2007. The arrears seemed to have ceased after that, and I infer that they were a consequence, rather than a cause, of the difficulties faced by the parties going forward. On balance, I would accept Mr&nbsp;Shiok’s evidence that he felt constrained to some extent by the investment he already put into the unit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these circumstances, I cannot unequivocally conclude that the mere entering into the second tenancy agreement can be regarded as wholly satisfying or displacing the <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span> raised by the estoppel. The just and correct approach would be to consider all these circumstances in satisfying the <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span> raised by the initial estoppel, bearing in mind that “[h]ere <span class="blueHighlight">equity</span> is displayed at its most flexible”: <em>per</em> Lord Denning&nbsp;MR in <em>Crabb v Arun District Council</em> [1976]&nbsp;Ch&nbsp;179 at&nbsp;189.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, I think an outright order to sell the unit to Mr&nbsp;Shiok is out of the question. Mr&nbsp;Shiok seemed to be in no position to buy the unit although he gave evidence of unnamed persons who were willing to back him up. In my view, the better and more precise remedy is an award of damages to put Mr&nbsp;Shiok into the position he would be in had he not entered into the two tenancy agreements. This would reverse any detriment he has suffered, as well as take into account any benefit he had enjoyed as a result of entering into the tenancy agreements. I should add that, on assessment, if Mr&nbsp;Shiok was in fact better off after the two tenancy agreements, then he would have suffered no detriment, and justice would have been served.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corollary of my judgment that damages are the appropriate remedy, Mr&nbsp;Shiok has no right to continue in the premises after the expiry of the second tenancy agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mezzanine floor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mezzanine floor issue is relevant for deciding whether the second tenancy agreement was rightfully terminated. However, it does not affect the overall proprietary estoppel analysis and it is thus not necessary for me to decide the point. It is sufficient for me to observe that the plaintiff, Heng Loong and Mr&nbsp;Lim (who was the agent of both the plaintiff and Heng Loong) do not seem to have conducted themselves in a way that was beyond reproach in their dealings with Mr&nbsp;Shiok.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore give judgment in the following terms:</p> <p></p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If he has not already done so, Mr&nbsp;Shiok is to vacate the unit within six&nbsp;weeks of this judgment, failing which he is to pay the plaintiff rent at the rate of $6,400 a month, pro-rated accordingly.</div><p></p> <p></p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr&nbsp;Shiok is entitled to damages to be assessed to restore him to the position he would be in had he not entered into the two tenancy agreements. The registrar is to assess the totality of rental, renovations and mezzanine floor payments made by him against the totality of benefits received by him in connection with the first tenancy until the date of vacation of the premises. Subject to this overriding aim, the assessing registrar should consider, <em>inter alia</em>, the amount of money Mr&nbsp;Shiok spent on renovating and improving the unit, including the building and removal of the mezzanine floor and the profits from his business conducted therein. I appreciate that a precise measure would not be possible – any evidential difficulties should be resolved in an equitable manner and in the spirit of my judgment.</div><p></p> <p></p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The parties are at liberty to clarify the terms of my orders above, and to apply for any ancillary order to give effect to my judgment.</div><p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Shiok is entitled to his costs of the trial.
