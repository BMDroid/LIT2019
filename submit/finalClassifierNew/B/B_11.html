Subsequently, LTA instructed Sato Kogyo to suspend RDC’s supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete (“LTA’s suspension”) due to the concrete showing an unacceptable amount <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cube failure. During the period <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> LTA’s suspension, Sato Kogyo obtained all its concrete from Pan United Concrete Pte Ltd (“Pan United”) at rates higher than those stipulated in its <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> with RDC.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">Later on, LTA approved Sato Kogyo’s request to allow RDC to resume concrete supply, with supply being restricted to concrete produced at RDC’s Kaki Bukit plant. Thereafter, RDC failed, on at least 42 occasions, to supply concrete ordered by Sato Kogyo, citing reasons <span class="blueHighlight">of</span>: (a)&nbsp;shortages <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw material, <em>ie</em>, aggregates and cement; and (b)&nbsp;plant breakdowns. Sato Kogyo had to purchase concrete from alternative suppliers at higher rates. Pursuant to its <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> with RDC, Sato Kogyo deducted all the cost differentials incurred from the outstanding amounts due to RDC, which RDC maintained it was not liable for by invoking the contractual clauses relating to <em>force majeure</em>. As a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> non-payment by Sato Kogyo, RDC eventually suspended its supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete (“RDC’s suspension”) and Sato Kogyo terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> shortly thereafter.</p> <p class="HN-Facts">Sato Kogyo instituted proceedings to claim damages for <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and RDC counterclaimed for amounts due under outstanding invoices for concrete supplied.

class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) Circle Line is a massive project that involves the linking <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the present North-South Line, East-West Line and North-East Line. It will cost approximately $6.7bn to build and will consist <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 29 stations spanning some 33.3km. In June 2003, Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”) was appointed by the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) as the main contractor for one <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the 29 stations, namely, the Lorong Chuan Station (“the Project”). The present litigation arises in relation to the construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that station.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff invited several suppliers to submit quotations for the supply and delivery <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> ready-mixed concrete for the Project. The Plaintiff eventually <span class="blueHighlight">contracted</span> with RDC Concrete Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”), an established local supplier <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> ready-mixed concrete, for the supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete at stipulated rates for the Project. It was not disputed that the Defendant’s revised quotation dated 1&nbsp;September 2003 and the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent dated 16&nbsp;September 2003 formed the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> between the parties. These two documents will hereafter be collectively referred to as “the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>, the Defendant was to supply approximately 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff at the stipulated prices between 1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>September 2003 and 30&nbsp;June 2006. This was in accordance with cl&nbsp;2 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s revised quotation, which provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><span class="blueHighlight">CONTRACT</span> PERIOD AND CONCRETE QUANTITY</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above quoted prices shall be held firm from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2003 to 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June 2006 and the concrete quantity to be supplied to the project is estimated to be approximately 70,000m<sup>3</sup>. This <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> shall cease to be valid upon the expiry <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period or the supplied concrete quantity, whichever is earlier.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May and June 2004, several tests were conducted on the specific strength <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the concrete supplied by the Defendant and it was found that there was an unacceptable amount <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cube failure. As a result, on 3<sup>&nbsp;</sup>July 2004, the LTA instructed the Plaintiff to suspend the Defendant’s concrete supply for <em>structural</em> elements. The LTA stipulated that the only approved concrete supplier during the suspension period was Pan United Concrete Pte Ltd (“Pan United”). The Defendant continued to supply concrete for <em>non-structural</em> elements during the suspension period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17&nbsp;November 2004, the LTA approved the Plaintiff’s request to allow the Defendant to resume concrete supply. Supply was, however, restricted to concrete produced at the Defendant’s Kaki Bukit plant. In addition to the Kaki Bukit plant, the Defendant also had plants at Kallang and Gay World. In its letter to the Plaintiff dated 17&nbsp;November 2004, the LTA stated that it was to be informed in advance if the need to use other plants arose.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial judge (“the Judge”) found that the period <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> suspension effectively lasted from 7&nbsp;July 2004 to 17&nbsp;November 2004 (see <em>Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd v RDC Concrete Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/51808-M.xml&#39;)"></a><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/51808-M.xml&#39;)">[2006] SGHC&nbsp;213</a> (“the GD”) at [27]). During this period, the Plaintiff obtained all its concrete from Pan United. The rates charged by Pan United were higher than those stipulated in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. By way <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> letters written on 3&nbsp;July 2004 and 12&nbsp;July 2004, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant that it would charge the Defendant for the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from alternative suppliers during the suspension period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Defendant was allowed to resume supply from 18&nbsp;November 2004 onwards, it was undisputed that the Defendant failed, on no fewer than 42 occasions, to supply concrete ordered by the Plaintiff under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. The Defendant was either wholly unable to meet the Plaintiff’s orders or could only supply part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the volume <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete ordered. The Defendant would give various reasons for its failure to supply the concrete. These reasons can be broadly categorised into two classes: (a)&nbsp;shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw materials, namely, aggregates and cement; and (b)&nbsp;plant breakdowns. <span class="blueHighlight">Of</span> the 42 occasions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> non- or short supply, there were also instances where the Defendant did not provide a reason for its failure to supply.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the Plaintiff’s construction schedule was disrupted and it was subjected to delay and inconvenience. The Plaintiff had to purchase concrete from alternative suppliers, in particular, Pan United, at rates higher than those stipulated in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Pursuant to cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent, the Plaintiff deducted all the cost differentials incurred from the outstanding amounts due to the Defendant. Clause&nbsp;8 provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that your supply is unable to meet LTA’s requirements, or you are unable to continue your supply, Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd reserves the right to terminate your <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and retain and use both the retention sum and any outstanding payment due to you to seek for alternative source <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply. In addition, Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd also reserves the right to seek from you any direct cost incurred due to your non-compliance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant maintained that it was not liable for the cost differentials as the circumstances that gave rise to the non- or short supply fell within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Clause&nbsp;3 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s revised quotation provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>3.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>FORCE MAJEURE</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any circumstance constituting Force Majeure, which is defined as act <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> God, or due to any cause beyond the supplier’s control, such as market raw material shortages, unforeseen plant breakdowns or labour disputes, the duty <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the affected party to perform its obligations shall be suspended or limited until such circumstance ceases.</p> <p class="Judg-1">Clause&nbsp;J <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appendix&nbsp;1A <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s revised quotation (incorporated by cl&nbsp;5 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the same) similarly provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any circumstance constituting Force Majeure, which is defined as act <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> God, or due to any cause beyond The Supplier’s control, such as market raw material shortages, unforeseen plant breakdowns or labour disputes, the duty <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the affected party to perform its obligations shall be suspended or limited until such circumstance ceases. In any event, The Supplier shall not be liable in any way for loss or damage arising directly or indirectly through or in consequence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> such events or happenings.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant repeatedly pursued the Plaintiff for the outstanding amounts due and payable to it for the concrete that it had already supplied. The Defendant maintained that it was not liable for the cost differentials and that the Plaintiff’s deduction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the same from the outstanding amounts due to the Defendant was unjustified and wrongful. As a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s non-payment, the Defendant suspended supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete on 5&nbsp;April 2005.

The Defendant maintained that the LTA’s requirements <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C and 28 days strength were mutually exclusive and proposed to change the peak core temperature to 80<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C. The LTA rejected the Defendant’s proposal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff then instituted the present action to claim damages for <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.

In so far as issue&nbsp;(a) was concerned, the Judge held that the parties had not agreed to enter into an exclusive or sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. The main reason for this holding lay in the fact that there was no express term stating that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was exclusive. Further, the absence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a priority term in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> indicated that the Plaintiff was not entitled to priority in supply by the Defendant at the expense <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s other customers. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff was at liberty to obtain concrete from Pan United even when the Defendant was able to supply the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as issue&nbsp;(b) was concerned, the Judge found that the Plaintiff could not claim the cost differentials incurred during the suspension period. This stemmed from her finding that cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent required the Plaintiff to <em>first</em> terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> before it could claim the cost differentials. As the Plaintiff only terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on 30&nbsp;May 2005, the Judge reasoned that the Plaintiff was precluded from claiming the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from an alternative supplier prior to that date. Secondly, the Judge also held that the cost differentials did not fall within the meaning <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term “direct cost” in cl&nbsp;8.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as issue&nbsp;(c) was concerned, the Judge held that the <em>force majeure</em> clauses applied to justify non- or short supply due to shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw materials, but did not exempt the Defendant from liability arising from unforeseen plant breakdowns. Accordingly, the Defendant was liable only for the cost differentials incurred as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> non- or short supply arising from plant breakdowns.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as issue&nbsp;(d) was concerned, the Judge held that the Defendant was entitled to suspend supply on 5&nbsp;April 2005 as some payments were made by the Plaintiff later than the 30-day credit term allowed under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Further, the Judge found that some <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the deductions made by the Plaintiff from the outstanding amounts due to the Defendant were unjustified.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as issue&nbsp;(e) was concerned, the Judge held that the Plaintiff had discharged its burden <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> proving that it was entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> both on the grounds <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s non- or short supply as well as its failure to supply concrete that adhered to the LTA’s specifications.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Judge also entered judgment for the Defendant on its counterclaim <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> $236,802.64. The counterclaim was not disputed by the Plaintiff and is not an issue in this appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Civil Appeal No&nbsp;152 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 2006 (“CA&nbsp;152”), the Plaintiff appealed against the Judge’s findings on issues&nbsp;(a), (b), (c) and (d). In Civil Appeal No&nbsp;151 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 2006 (“CA&nbsp;151”), the Defendant appealed on the Judge’s findings with respect to issues&nbsp;(c) and (e). These issues will now be considered in turn.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue&nbsp;(a) – Was the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> an “exclusive” or “sole supplier” <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff contended that it was an implied term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was to be an “exclusive” or “sole supplier” <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. As a result, the Plaintiff was obliged to obtain all its concrete from the Defendant during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period. The implication <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this argument is that the Plaintiff would be entitled to look to the Defendant for the cost differentials incurred as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from alternative suppliers if the Defendant was unable to meet the Plaintiff’s orders and the <em>force majeure</em> clauses did not apply to relieve the Defendant <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> its obligations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not disputed that the Defendant was free to supply concrete to other contractors during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period. The only issue in contention was whether the Plaintiff was contractually obliged to purchase all its concrete <em>solely</em> from the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge held that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was <em>not</em> an exclusive or sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> for the following reasons (see the GD at [25]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no term stating that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was exclusive.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a priority term in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> indicated that the Plaintiff was not entitled to priority supply by the Defendant at the expense <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> its other customers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A project plant was not specifically set up to supply the Plaintiff with concrete for the Project.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant fulfilled orders on a first come, first served basis.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff was at liberty to use Pan United even at times when the Defendant was able to supply concrete.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We affirm the Judge’s finding that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was not an exclusive or sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. Most importantly, and as the Judge had noted, this was not an express term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. This should be contrasted with the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> subsequently entered into between the Plaintiff and Island Concrete Pte Ltd on 1&nbsp;August 2005 wherein cl&nbsp;2.1 expressly provided that the “prices are specially quoted based on the condition that we will be the sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> ready-mixed concrete to your above jobsite” [emphasis in original].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reject the Plaintiff’s argument that a sole supplier term could be implied into the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. It is established law that a court will only imply terms into a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> where such terms are necessary to give business efficacy to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> or where the term represents the obvious, but unexpressed, intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0927.xml&#39;)">[2006] 1&nbsp;SLR(R) 927</a> at [29]–[41]). In order to uphold the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> sanctity and freedom <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, courts have generally been reluctant to imply terms into <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span>, especially <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span> entered into between two commercial parties. Based on the argument that the quotation for 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete was a <em>bona fide</em> estimate <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the total volume required for the Project, the Plaintiff sought to imply a term that only <em>one</em> supplier was required for the entire Project. In particular, the Plaintiff argued that the commercial objectives <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> both parties would be achieved with the implication <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> such a term as the Plaintiff could get better fixed rates for bulk purchase and the Defendant would be able to supply a substantial volume <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to keep its production arm in operation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate to commence the analysis <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this issue by revisiting cl&nbsp;2 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s revised quotation, which provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><span class="blueHighlight">CONTRACT</span> PERIOD AND CONCRETE QUANTITY</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above quoted prices shall be held firm from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2003 to 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June 2006 and the concrete quantity to be supplied to the project is estimated to be approximately 70,000m<sup>3</sup>. This <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> shall cease to be valid upon the expiry <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period or the supplied concrete quantity, whichever is earlier.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a literal interpretation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;2, the Defendant is obliged to supply approximately 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff at the stated prices during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period. Conversely, the Plaintiff’s obligation is to obtain up to 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete from the Defendant at the stated rates during the contractual period. Where the Plaintiff orders more than 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete, the stated prices no longer apply and the parties are free to engage in further negotiations for fresh rates.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, it is appropriate to refer to the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Nam Kee Asphalt Pte Ltd v Chew Eu Hock Construction Co Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Judgment/4540-M.xml&#39;)">[2000] SGHC&nbsp;45</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, the court was concerned with a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> for the supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> aggregates. The <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> provided that the “estimated quantity” to be supplied under the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> was 40,000 tonnes. On the facts, the defendant ordered and paid for only 8,643.42 tonnes. The plaintiff sought to recover the loss <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> profits <em>vis-à-vis</em> the unsold balance and argued that it was an implied term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> that the defendant should purchase from the plaintiff <em>all</em> the aggregates it required in respect <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, <em>ie</em>, that the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> was exclusive in nature. Lee Seiu Kin&nbsp;JC (as he then was) rejected this argument, observing thus (at [15]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Considering the factors above, firstly there is nothing in the language <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> nor in the circumstances under which it was entered into that raises an inference that the parties had intended that there be an exclusivity clause. Such a clause is neither necessary to give business efficacy to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> nor does it represent the obvious intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties. It is common for a vendor to give an open quotation to a purchaser for the latter to make orders as he deems necessary. Implying the exclusivity clause does not make the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> any more efficacious; instead it alters the nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the bargain considerably. As such, I cannot see how it can pass the “officious bystander” test. I therefore do not see any basis whatsoever to imply the exclusivity term into the Aggregates <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein, it is difficult to see how the implication <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a sole supplier term on the present facts would lend business efficacy to the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> or would satisfy the test <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the officious bystander. In fact, implying such a term would considerably alter the nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the bargain as the Plaintiff would be deemed to be in <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> whenever it obtained concrete from alternative suppliers during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period, <em>even if</em> it had already purchased the requisite 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete from the Defendant. This result could hardly have been intended by the parties. In fact, Yew, the Plaintiff’s project manager, testified that more than 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete would be needed for the entire Project. Indeed, if the Project had proceeded along faster than expected and resulted in the Plaintiff requiring more than 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period, counsel did not suggest that the Plaintiff would be in <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> had it then purchased concrete from alternative suppliers. <span class="blueHighlight">Of</span> significance, too, is the fact that the Judge had accepted the evidence that the Plaintiff had obtained concrete from Pan United even when the Defendant was able to supply.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were fortified in our conclusion by noting the conspicuous absence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a “priority term” in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Notably, a priority term would entail the dedication <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a project plant to supplying concrete for a project and would ensure that the customer had priority <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply. In such cases, the project plant could only supply other customers after the project customer’s requirements had been fully satisfied. The Plaintiff must have understood that it would obtain its supply from a “commercial plant” (which would entail the Defendant’s supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete being distributed amongst its many customers), and not from a dedicated project plant. When the Plaintiff required more than the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> quantity, it was always open to the Plaintiff to purchase concrete from other suppliers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore reject the Plaintiff’s argument that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> is an exclusive or sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and dismiss the Plaintiff’s appeal on this particular issue.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue&nbsp;(b) – Could the Plaintiff claim for the cost differentials incurred during the suspension period (between 7&nbsp;July 2004 and 17&nbsp;November 2004)?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background and issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the failure <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> several cube tests conducted between May to June 2004 on the concrete supplied by the Defendant, the LTA suspended the Defendant’s supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff from 7&nbsp;July 2004 to 17&nbsp;November 2004. During this period, the Plaintiff obtained concrete from Pan United. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant was liable for the resulting cost differentials and deducted the same from the outstanding payments due to the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This claim is based on cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent, which will be set out once again for ease <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> reference:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that your supply is unable to meet LTA’s requirements, or you are unable to continue your supply, Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd reserves the right to terminate your <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and retain and use both the retention sum and any outstanding payment due to you to seek for alternative source <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply. <em>In addition, Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd also reserves the right to seek from you any direct cost incurred due to your non-compliance</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff argued that the first sentence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;8 conferred on it <em>dual rights</em> in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s inability to meet the LTA’s requirements and/or to continue its supply, <em>viz</em>, the right to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> and/or the right to seek for alternative supply and recover the cost differentials from the Defendant, respectively. Thus, the Plaintiff could choose to exercise either or both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> these rights and, consequently, could claim the cost differentials without first terminating the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. The Plaintiff also argued that the cost differentials fell within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term “direct cost” in the second sentence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;8.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, the Defendant contended, first, that cl&nbsp;8 would only apply where the Plaintiff had first terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Since the Plaintiff terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> only on 30&nbsp;May 2005, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff could not claim the cost differentials incurred between 7&nbsp;July 2004 and 17&nbsp;November 2004. Secondly, the Defendant denied that the cost differentials were a “direct cost”. The Defendant argued that it was, instead, a “consequential loss” and that the Defendant’s liability for such loss was therefore excluded by cl&nbsp;D <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appendix&nbsp;1A <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s revised quotation (incorporated by cl&nbsp;5 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the same), which provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cube strength results must be made known to The Supplier within 7 days after the 28 days test result. Should there be cube failure, The Purchaser is to inform The Supplier in writing within 14 days, otherwise The Supplier shall not be held responsible for any such failure. Should the concrete supplied fail to meet all compliance tests, The Supplier undertakes to supply to The Purchaser, free <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> charge, the volume <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete judged defective. <em>The Supplier shall not be liable for any claims whatsoever for consequential and/or other damages</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate, the Judge held that the Plaintiff was <em>not</em> entitled to claim the cost differentials incurred during the suspension period for two reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cl&nbsp;8, it was a precondition that the Plaintiff had first to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> before it could claim the cost differentials. Since the Plaintiff did not terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> until 30&nbsp;May 2005, it was precluded from claiming the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> purchasing concrete from alternative suppliers prior to that date.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> purchasing concrete from an alternative supplier were not a “direct cost” and therefore the Defendant was not liable for the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1">The two sub-issues will be discussed separately.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">First sub-issue – Whether termination <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> by the Plaintiff under clause&nbsp;8 was a precondition to recovery <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the cost differentials</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this issue hinges on the proper construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;8. On a literal interpretation, it is clear that in the event where the Defendant’s supply is unable to meet the LTA’s requirements or the Defendant is unable to continue its supply, the Plaintiff expressly “reserves” two rights: (a)&nbsp;the right to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and retain and use both the retention and outstanding payments due to the Defendant to seek alternative sources <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply; <em>and/or</em> (b)&nbsp;the right to seek any direct costs incurred by the Plaintiff due to the Defendant’s non-compliance. These two rights are disjunctive inasmuch as the right to recover direct costs is “[i]n addition” to, and not dependent on, the right to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. This means that while the Plaintiff’s right to apply the retention and outstanding sums due to the Defendant towards the cost differential <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from an alternative supplier was contingent on the Plaintiff’s termination <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>, its right to seek direct costs was not subject to such a precondition. In other words, the Plaintiff could claim direct costs incurred as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <em>even if it had not terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span></em>. We therefore respectfully disagree with the Judge’s construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;8.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the <em>general position at common law</em> is clear beyond peradventure: even if the innocent party (here, the Plaintiff) is not entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> or, if so entitled, chooses nevertheless not to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, it will, generally speaking, <em>always</em> be entitled to claim <em>damages as <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> right</em> for loss resulting from the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> (or <span class="blueHighlight">breaches</span>) <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>: see the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Raineri v Miles</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67577-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1981] AC&nbsp;1050</a>.

In the absence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> clear words, therefore, the common law position that a plaintiff is entitled to damages upon a defendant’s <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> was preserved and operated as a <em>separate</em> right which was referred to in <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_39">[39]</a> above. The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to claim for direct costs incurred due to the Defendant’s inability to meet the LTA’s requirements even though the Plaintiff had not terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. We turn now to the issue <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> whether the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from alternative suppliers fall within the definition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term “direct cost”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second sub-issue – Whether the cost differentials fall within the definition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> “direct cost” under clause&nbsp;8</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in this area is well settled.

Thus, the court is not concerned with <em>actual knowledge</em> on the part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the defendant. The defendant is taken to know, under the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>imputed</em> knowledge, that such damage would <em>ordinarily</em> ensue as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>: see the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>CHS CPO GmbH v Vikas Goel</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0202.xml&#39;)">[2005] 3&nbsp;SLR(R) 202</a> at [82].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge held that the Defendant was not liable for the cost differentials because it would be “straining the language to say the price differential <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> an alternative supplier would come under the meaning <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> ‘direct cost’” (see the GD at [52]). With respect, we are unable to agree with the Judge’s conclusion. In our view, the cost differentials were a direct cost or loss that flowed directly and naturally from the Defendant’s inability to supply concrete that met with the LTA’s requirements. Since the Project was a major project <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a public nature, the Defendant would or should have known that it would be stringently regulated by the LTA. It should have been within the Defendant’s reasonable contemplation that, had the concrete it supplied not satisfied the LTA’s requirements, the LTA would suspend its supply for an indefinite period. In fact, the Defendant should have been well aware <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the manner in which the LTA operated since it was an experienced participant in the field and would have been previously involved in similar large-scale construction projects. In circumstances where the Defendant’s supply was suspended, it was reasonable for both parties to contemplate that construction should continue and that the Plaintiff would therefore have to seek alternative sources <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete elsewhere. This was particularly so because, <em>at the material time</em>, the parties did not know how long the suspension would last. In addition, the Plaintiff was liable for a huge amount <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> liquidated damages to the tune <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> $100,000 per day for delay. It would also have been in the reasonable contemplation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> both parties that concrete, which would then have to be purchased from the market on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis, would necessarily be more expensive than the rates charged by the Defendant. After all, the Defendant itself had argued that the only reason why it was able to offer “rock-bottom rates” was because the Plaintiff had purchased the concrete in bulk.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to claim the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining concrete from Pan United incurred between 7&nbsp;July 2004 and 17&nbsp;November 2004 because this was a direct cost that naturally resulted from the Defendant’s inability to meet with the LTA’s requirements. The Plaintiff’s appeal on this particular issue is therefore allowed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue&nbsp;(c) – Did the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> apply so as to exempt the Defendant from liability to the Plaintiff for non-supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete between 18&nbsp;November 2004 and 5&nbsp;April 2005? </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background and issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the LTA suspension order was lifted on 17&nbsp;November 2004, the Defendant resumed supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff. It was, however, not disputed that from 18&nbsp;November 2004 to 5&nbsp;April 2005, there were numerous occasions on which the Defendant was unable to supply <em>all</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s requirements. The Defendant attributed this to two main causes: (a)&nbsp;a shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw materials (in particular, cement and aggregates); and (b)&nbsp;plant breakdowns. On these occasions, the Plaintiff had to seek alternative sources <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply which were invariably procured at a higher price. The Plaintiff claimed the cost differentials <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> obtaining alternative supplies <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete during this period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plaintiff’s claim for the cost differentials incurred during this period was based on cl&nbsp;8. The construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cl&nbsp;8 as discussed above would similarly apply here. The Plaintiff was thus <em>prima facie</em> entitled to claim the direct costs incurred as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s non- or short supply. The only issue to determine is whether the <em>force majeure</em> clauses applied so as to exempt the Defendant from liability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> have already been set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_9">[9]</a> above. The effect <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> both the clauses is the same: If the circumstances stated therein are satisfied, the Defendant’s obligation to supply concrete will be suspended. The practical implication is, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> course, that the Defendant will, as a result, not be liable for any cost differentials incurred during this period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge held that while the Defendant could invoke the <em>force majeure</em> clauses to justify non-supply to the Plaintiff due to a market shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw materials, it could not do so for non-supply due to unforeseen plant breakdowns. The Defendant was therefore held liable for the cost differentials incurred on occasions when the non- or short supply was due to plant breakdowns, but <em>not</em> on other occasions when the non- or short supply was due to the market shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> raw materials.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issue <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> pleadings</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, this particular issue can be easily resolved on the ground that the Defendant had not even pleaded <em>force majeure</em> in its defence to begin with. In its defence and counterclaim filed on 15&nbsp;August 2005, the Defendant only made passing reference to the fact that it could not meet the Plaintiff’s requests for supply due to unavailability <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> materials or plant breakdowns. Thus, para&nbsp;7 pleaded as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendants shall aver that under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>, especially under Paragraph&nbsp;2 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendants’ Letter, the Defendants merely had to supply the Plaintiffs ready-mixed concrete in bulk to the extent <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> approximately 70,000m<sup>3</sup> during the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> Period. There was no stipulation for specific date and / or volumes for supply during the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> Period. <em>The Defendants shall aver that on occasions when they could not meet the Plaintiffs’ requests for supply for whatever reason (such as for insufficient notice, unavailability <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> materials or breakdown <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> plant), they would propose alternative supply dates or volumes based on their constraints</em>. However, it was the Plaintiffs who would not accept such alternative proposals, choosing to go to alternative suppliers instead. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is insufficient to enable the Defendant to rely on the defence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> as embodied in the clauses set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_9">[9]</a> above. In our view, the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> is a matter that must be specifically pleaded before it can be relied on by a party. In this regard, O&nbsp;18 r&nbsp;8(1) <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Rules <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Court (Cap&nbsp;322, R&nbsp;5, 2006&nbsp;Rev Ed) stipulates matters that must be specifically pleaded as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> claim plead specifically any matter, for example, performance, <em>release</em>, any relevant statute <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he alleges makes any claim or defence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the opposite party not maintainable;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which raises issues <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> fact not arising out <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the preceding pleading.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite law that the court is not entitled to make a decision on an issue which has not been raised by the parties in their pleadings: see, for example, the Malaysian High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Janagi v Ong Boon Kiat</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/36203-M.xml&#39;)">[1971] 2&nbsp;MLJ 196</a> and the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd&nbsp;v Intraco Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1992] 2 SLR(R) 0382.xml&#39;)">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 382</a>, both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> which have often been cited as authority for this important proposition in the local context. It is sufficient, on this ground alone, to dispose <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this issue. However, we should add that although the courts do not generally countenance the raising <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> arid and technical procedural objections that would hinder the attainment <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> justice in the case at hand, they would, equally, reject arguments (such as that now proffered) where there has been such a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> procedural justice that countenancing it would result in substantive prejudice and injustice to the innocent party (which would be the case in the present appeal in so far as the Plaintiff was concerned). However, as the Judge had found that the <em>force majeure</em> clauses applied to partially exempt the Defendant from liability, and there is a dearth <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> local case law in relation to the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>, it would be useful to discuss this issue in greater detail (assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the defective pleadings were not fatal to the Defendant’s case on this particular point). To this end, it would be appropriate to first set out some <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the basic principles applicable to <em>force majeure</em> clauses.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Some general principles relating to force majeure clauses</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal purpose <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <em>force majeure</em> clause is to <em>contractually</em> allocate the risks between the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties with regard to the occurrence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> future events in specific circumstances, all <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> which are stipulated within the clause itself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important principle with respect to <em>force majeure</em> clauses entails, simultaneously, a rather specific factual inquiry: the <em>precise construction</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause is paramount as it would define the <em>precise scope and ambit</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause itself. The court is, in accordance with the principle <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> freedom <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, to give full effect to the intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties in so far as such a clause is concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to more specific principles, an appropriate starting point would be the following observations by Prof&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;Guenter Treitel, one <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the leading academic commentators on <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> law in the Commonwealth, in the leading work in this particular area <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the law (see Sir&nbsp;Guenter Treitel, <em><span class="blueHighlight">Frustration</span> and Force Majeure</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd&nbsp;Ed, 2004) at para&nbsp;12-001):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two main themes or policies underlie the law relating to the discharge <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span> by supervening events [under the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>]. The first is that the purpose <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> discharge is to find a satisfactory way <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> allocating the loss caused by such events. The second is that the doctrine should not be so widely applied as to undermine the sanctity <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and that it should therefore be applied only where the change brought about by the supervening event is a fundamental one. <em>Both these policies are, however, subject to the general principle <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> freedom <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span></em>, which in the present context can operate in two ways. First, it can <em>exclude the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> discharge</em> where the parties have <span class="blueHighlight">contracted</span> on terms <em>which indicate that the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is to remain in being in spite <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the occurrence</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> an event which would, but for such a provision [<em>viz</em>, the <em>force majeure clause</em>], have discharged it. Secondly, it can enable the parties <em>to provide for discharge</em>, or some other form <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> relief, on the occurrence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any event which, <em>but for the provision, would have had no effect on their legal rights and duties because the change <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> circumstances brought about by the event was not sufficiently serious or fundamental to discharge the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> under the general common law doctrine. Contractual provisions for supervening events may therefore, on the one hand, exclude <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> and, on the other, provide relief for non-frustrating events</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Conceptually</em>, it is true that a <em>force majeure</em> clause operates differently from the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>. Whereas a <em>force majeure</em> clause is an agreement as to how outstanding obligations should be resolved upon the onset <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <em>foreseeable</em> event, the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> concerns the treatment <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> contractual obligations from the onset <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> an <em>unforeseeable</em> event: see the decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this court in <em>Glahe International Expo AG v ACS Computer Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 0945.xml&#39;)">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 945</a> (“<em>Glahe</em>”) at [26]. The prevalent practice <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> incorporating <em>force majeure</em> clauses into commercial <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span> today stems largely from the blunt nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> as a tool to allocate loss. It has often been said that the juridical basis for the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> is unclear, the doctrine is difficult to invoke and the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> its operation are drastic, in the sense that the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is automatically brought to an end. Parties therefore often include <em>force majeure</em> clauses in their <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span> to avoid the uncertainty and hardship that might otherwise result from relying on the common law doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>. Uncertainty and inconvenience are avoided by incorporating a well-drafted clause that clearly defines the events or circumstances that constitute <em>force majeure</em>. Hardship is also minimised in so far as a <em>force majeure</em> clause can be crafted to provide a more nuanced response to events <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>. For example, it may be provided that, in circumstances constituting <em>force majeure</em>, an extension <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> time may be granted to the party in default, there may be cancellation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> at the option <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> one party, or the defaulting party’s duty to perform the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> will be suspended. The <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is thus not automatically brought to an end.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this conceptual distinction, we are <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the view that the principles relating to the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> are, in the vast majority <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cases, still relevant to the construction and interpretation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> clauses. In this regard, it is important to note that, by their <em>very nature and function</em>, <em>force majeure</em> clauses would – in the ordinary course <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> events – be triggered only where there was a radical external event that supervened and that was not due to the fault <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> either <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties. It will be immediately noticed that this is <em>also</em> a prerequisite to the invocation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>. However, this, admittedly, is not invariably the case. There might, for instance, be <em>force majeure</em> clauses, the language <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> which falls <em>short</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> meeting the criteria required with respect to the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> at common law (this is clearly envisaged, for example, by Prof&nbsp;Treitel in the passage quoted in <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_55">[55]</a> above and see also <em><span class="blueHighlight">Frustration</span> and Force Majeure</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_55">[55]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at para&nbsp;12-017). We should think, however, that this would not be common, especially if one accepts the basic premise that the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> centres (in large part at least) on the absence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> reasonable control on the part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties. As S&nbsp;Rajendran&nbsp;J observed in the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Magenta Resources (S) Pte Ltd&nbsp;v China Resources (S) Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0316.xml&#39;)">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 316</a> at [60] (“<em>Magenta Resources</em>”) (affirmed in <em>China Resources (S) Pte Ltd v Magenta Resources (S) Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1997] 1 SLR(R) 0103.xml&#39;)">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 103</a>, but without apparent consideration <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this particular point):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is referred to as <em>force majeure</em> in our law (as opposed to French law from which that term originates) is really no more than a convenient way <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> referring to contractual terms that the parties have agreed upon to deal with situations that might arise, <em>over which the parties have little or no control</em>, that might impede or obstruct the performance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. There can therefore be no general rule as to what constitutes a situation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>.

In the present appeal, for example, the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> (reproduced at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_9">[9]</a> above) refer to causes that are “beyond the supplier’s control”. Depending on the precise facts before the court, the cause or event in question could be beyond the supplier’s (here, the Defendant’s) control and, yet, not beyond the other party’s control (here, the Plaintiff).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it should be emphasised that the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> can be successfully invoked only if the alleged frustrating event is an <em>external</em> one that is, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, beyond the control <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>both</em> <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties (also bearing in mind the important complementary principle that there can be <em>no self-induced</em> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>). In the oft-cited words <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lord&nbsp;Radcliffe in the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/63059-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] AC&nbsp;696</a> at 729:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[F]rustration occurs whenever the law recognizes that <em>without the default <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> either party</em>- a contractual obligation has become incapable <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing <em>radically different</em> from that which was undertaken by the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in the construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <em>force majeure</em> clause (similar to those found in the present case), the courts will apply “the presumption that the expression force majeure is likely to be restricted to supervening events which <em>arise without the fault <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> either party</em> and for which neither <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> them has undertaken responsibility” [emphasis added]: see the English High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>The Kriti Rex</em> [1996] 2&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 171 at 196, <em>per</em> Moore-Bick&nbsp;J (as he then was).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whatever the precise content <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <em>force majeure</em> clause (which, coupled with the precise facts <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the case, would determine, in turn, the precise relationship between that clause and the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>), it is important to emphasise that where a <em>force majeure</em> clause <em>excludes</em> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>, the principal effect and difference between the two is with respect to the <em>nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the relief</em>. The relief available under a <em>force majeure</em> clause will, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> course, be determined by the specific content <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that clause itself. In a situation where the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> is sought to be excluded, the clause concerned would expressly stipulate that the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is <em>not</em> to be discharged <em>despite</em> the fact that the situation would otherwise be one that would have frustrated the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> in the present appeal are a paradigm illustration. Whilst they are triggered or catalysed only if the relevant event is “beyond the supplier’s control” and, to that extent, appear to embody some <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the common law principles relating to the <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, the <em>crucial difference</em> lies, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in the <em>nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the relief</em> that will be granted. If these clauses apply, the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> “shall be <em>suspended or limited until</em> such circumstance ceases” [emphasis added]. In <em>contrast</em>, where a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is <em>frustrated</em> under the common law, it is <em>automatically discharged by operation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> law and</em> the precise relief would be determined by the provisions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Frustrated <span class="blueHighlight">Contracts</span> Act (Cap&nbsp;115, 1985&nbsp;Rev Ed) (“the Act”) instead (and see generally Andrew Stewart &amp; J&nbsp;W&nbsp;Carter, “Frustrated <span class="blueHighlight">Contracts</span> and Statutory Adjustment: The Case for a Reappraisal” [1992] CLJ&nbsp;66). It should also be noted that s&nbsp;3(3) <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Act itself clearly stipulates thus with respect to its very limited applicability in the context <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> clauses (this provision was in fact referred to in the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Chan Buck Kia v Naga Shipping &amp; Trading Co Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/34359-M.xml&#39;)">[1963] MLJ&nbsp;159</a> at 160):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where any <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> to which this Act applies contains any provision which, upon the true construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, is intended to have effect in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> circumstances arising which operate, or would but for that provision operate, to frustrate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not, the court shall give effect to that provision and shall only give effect to section&nbsp;2 to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with that provision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the <em>other hand</em>, where the <em>force majeure</em> clause concerned does <em>not exclude</em> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>, then, if the supervening event is indeed a frustrating event that, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, lies <em>beyond</em> the boundaries <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that clause, the legal consequences as described above (<em>ie</em>, which flow from an application <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the common law doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> and which entail an application <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the relevant provisions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Act) would follow instead. It is important, however, to note that there is no need to canvass the issue <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> relief in the present appeal as the only issue before us is whether or not the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> apply to the facts at hand. Indeed, no attempt was, in any event, made to argue that the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> applied to the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have already seen, it is clear that a <em>force majeure</em> clause can seek to <em>exclude</em> the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>. It is important, in this regard, to reiterate the basic proposition that <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties are, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> course, free to exclude the doctrine and, as emphasised above, the court must give full effect to such an agreement on the basis that these parties are at liberty to allocate the possible risks between them in any manner they see fit. Nevertheless, it is clear that in order to actually exclude the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>, the clause concerned must be clear and unambiguous. It should be noted, however, that the case law suggests that courts will construe <em>force majeure</em> clauses <em>strictly</em>: see, for example, the oft-cited House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decisions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Metropolitan Water Board v Dick, Kerr and Company, Limited</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/52917-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1918] AC&nbsp;119</a> (“<em>Metropolitan Water Board</em>”) and <em>Bank Line</em>, <em>Limited v Arthur Capel and Company</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/53249-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1919] AC&nbsp;435</a>. In other words, what often appears, at first blush at least, to be an express provision covering the event concerned is often interpreted by the courts as not intended by the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties to cover so drastic an event as a frustrating event; hence, the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> would continue, with the attendant consequences or relief briefly outlined in the paragraphs above. Indeed, it has been observed as follows (see Ewan McKendrick, <em>Force Majeure and <span class="blueHighlight">Frustration</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span></em> (Lloyd’s <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> London Press Ltd, 2nd&nbsp;Ed, 1995) at p&nbsp;36):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, therefore, extremely difficult, if not impossible, to draft a <em>force majeure</em> clause which shuts out the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> completely, because even the widest <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> clauses may be held not to cover a particular catastrophic event [such as in <em>Metropolitan Water Board</em>] …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another general principle to note is that a party who relies on the <em>force majeure</em> clause must show not only that it has brought itself within the clause concerned (a separate and extremely important point in itself: see below at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_65">[65]</a>) but also that it has taken all reasonable steps to avoid its operation, or mitigate its results: see the English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Channel Island Ferries Ltd v Sealink UK Ltd</em> [1988] 1&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 323 (“<em>Channel Island Ferries</em>”) at 327. This principle is not only commonsensical but is also consistent with (and may even be a corollary <span class="blueHighlight">of</span>) the very nature and function <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <em>force majeure</em> clause which we have in fact elaborated upon above (at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_53">[53]</a>). To briefly recapitulate, such a clause presupposes that events falling within its scope and ambit are beyond the control <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties and that language to this effect will invariably be utilised in the clause itself. Thus, in the English High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Continental Grain Export Corporation v STM Grain Ltd</em> [1979] 2&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 460 (“<em>Continental Grain Export</em>”), Robert Goff&nbsp;J (as he then was) said (at 473) that a seller who invoked a “prohibition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> export” clause (where the rubric <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> “impossibility” was utilised) had to prove that: (a)&nbsp;no goods <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> description were available to him to fulfil his <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>; and (b)&nbsp;he could not, following notice <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the event, obtain any such goods “by the exercise <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any means reasonably open to him”. This was approved (in relation to a similar clause) by the English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal in <em>Andre &amp; Cie SA v Tradax Export SA</em> [1983] 1&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 254 at 258.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it should also be noted that a party who relies on a <em>force majeure</em> clause has the burden <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> bringing himself squarely within that clause: see <em>Channel Island Ferries</em> (at 327); <em>Magenta Resources</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_57">[57]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em> at [98]); and <em>Chitty on <span class="blueHighlight">Contracts</span></em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th&nbsp;Ed, 2004) vol&nbsp;1 at para&nbsp;14-140.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the above principles in mind, we now turn to consider whether, had circumstances <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> been specifically pleaded, the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> would apply, in the first instance, to exempt the Defendant from liability for the cost differentials incurred where the non- or short supply was caused by market raw material shortages, in particular, aggregates and cement. The applicability <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> these clauses with respect to the non- or short supply caused by plant breakdowns will be considered later. It is also important to reiterate that no argument centring on the doctrine <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span> was proffered before either the Judge or this court and that, therefore, our only task, as just mentioned, is to ascertain whether or not the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> would, based on the facts before us, apply in the present appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Market raw material shortages</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the facts allegedly giving rise to market raw material shortages were insufficient to fall within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Consistent with the general principle set out above (at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_54">[54]</a>), the precise language and intent <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clauses are crucial as they define (in turn) the precise scope <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clauses themselves. It would therefore be appropriate to set out the clauses once again. As the clauses (set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_9">[9]</a> above) are word-for-word the same, it would suffice to set out the contents <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause just once, as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any circumstance constituting <em>Force Majeure</em>, <em>which is defined as</em> act <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> God, <em>or</em> due to <em>any</em> cause <em>beyond the supplier’s control</em>, <em>such as</em> market raw material shortages, <em>unforeseen</em> plant breakdowns or labour disputes, the duty <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the affected party to perform its obligations shall be <em>suspended or limited until such circumstance ceases</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the analysis <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause proper, we note, first, that the Defendant failed to produce sufficient evidence proving that there was, in fact, a market shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>cement</em>. The only evidence before the court was the oral evidence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s general manager who testified in re-examination that a drastic increase in freight charges in late 2004 had led to the reluctance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cement suppliers to commit to shipping cement. This was woefully insufficient.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in so far as the alleged shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>aggregates</em> is concerned, there is evidence that, sometime in mid-2004 to early 2005, there was an acute shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> aggregates in Singapore from traditional sources in Indonesia. This was due, <em>inter alia</em>, to: (a)&nbsp;a ban by the Indonesian government on the use <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> explosives for blasting, thereby severely restricting quarry operations; (b)&nbsp;unexpected operational problems by one <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the larger Indonesian operators; and (c)&nbsp;suspension <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply by the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) from one <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Indonesian operators due to suspected alkali-silica reactivity. As a result, the overall output <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the quarries was reduced and stockpiles were depleted to practically zero. Concrete producers were not always able to obtain aggregates in sufficient quantity and at the exact time to produce concrete to meet their customers’ casting schedules. All these facts were documented in a letter written by the Ready-Mix Concrete Association <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Singapore to the BCA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the presence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the above facts, we find that the Defendant had <em>not</em> discharged its burden <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> proving that the <em>force majeure</em> clauses applied <em>vis-à-vis</em> the shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>aggregates</em>. It is important, in this regard, to note the precise language utilised in the <em>force majeure</em> clauses concerned which have been reproduced at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_67">[67]</a> above. In particular, the phrase “beyond the supplier’s control” is <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> crucial significance. This phrase applies, <em>inter alia</em>, to market raw material shortages, as evidenced by the phrase “such as” which is interposed between that particular phrase and the rest <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause which refers to “market raw material shortages”. In other words, “market raw material shortages” are but one instance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a “cause <em>beyond the supplier’s control</em>” [emphasis added]. That being the case, it is clear that “market raw material shortages” would not constitute an event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> within the meaning <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the clause <em>unless</em> such shortages were “beyond the supplier’s control” (here, beyond the Defendant’s control). This is <em>clearly not</em> the case in the present appeal, as it was still <em>within</em> the Defendant’s power to purchase aggregates from the market, <em>albeit at a higher price</em>. It will also be recalled that a defendant who wishes to invoke a <em>force majeure</em> clause must prove, <em>inter alia</em>, that it could not obtain the goods “by the exercise <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any means reasonably open to [it]” (<em>per</em> Robert Goff&nbsp;J (as he then was) in <em>Continental Grain Export</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_64">[64]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) at 473). In our view, it was open to the Defendant to obtain aggregates from the market at a higher price. The <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> had merely become more <em>onerous</em> for the Defendant to perform, but the circumstances certainly did not constitute <em>force majeure</em> within the meaning <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the relevant clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion is consistent with the earlier decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this court in <em>Glahe</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_56">[56]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). In that case, the parties had entered into a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> for the sale and delivery <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> computers to Moscow. The court had to consider whether the imposition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> customs duty and/or the Russian inflation were events that fell within the <em>force majeure</em> clause, which provided as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Neither Party shall be responsible for the complete or partial non-performance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> its obligations, if the non-performance results from such circumstances as flood, fire, earthquake, and other Acts <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> God, as well as war, military operations, blockade, act or actions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> state authorities, or any other circumstances beyond the Parties’ control that have arisen after the conclusion <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> (except for failure to pay any sum which has become due under the provisions hereof).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the imposition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> customs duty was concerned, the court held (at [24]) that the imposition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a mere 15% tax was not so huge or astronomical as to constitute an event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>. The court found (at [25]) that the two events, taken together or singly, did not prevent the appellant from performing the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>; they only made the performance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> more expensive and costly. As a result, the court held that the appellant was not exempted from liability under the <em>force majeure</em> clause.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal in <em>Brauer &amp; Co (Gt Britain), Ltd&nbsp;v James Clark (Brush Materials)</em>, <em>Ltd</em> [1952] 2&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 147 held that a 20% to 30% increase in prices merely made it more unprofitable for the sellers to perform their contractual obligations, but did not constitute circumstances <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> aggregates in the market merely made it more <em>expensive</em> and <em>costly</em> for the defendant to perform the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. In addition, we wonder whether the Defendant may have consciously opted to supply concrete to other purchasers who were willing to pay higher rates and who, unlike the Plaintiff, were not locked into fixed-price <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span>. This would, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> course, be unacceptable. In a related vein, we note that the Judge had also observed as follows (see the GD at [137]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was Nobes’ [the Defendant’s general manager’s] evidence that the defendant was keen to secure the plaintiff’s order, even at a (calculated) loss. Hence, the defendant’s various quotations which led up to the eight[h] and final quotation dated 1&nbsp;September 2003 gradually lowered the prices <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete mixes across the board but for incrementally higher volumes. Ho [the Defendant’s assistant general manager] had earlier revealed that the defendant took a ‘budgeted loss’ on the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> … In re-examination … Nobes explained the rationale for the defendant’s willingness to give rock bottom prices to the plaintiff. He said it was because the defendant wanted to retain its market share in the ready-mix concrete industry to keep its plant running. It could only do that if its order books generated sufficient volume for the capacity <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> its plant. <em>That would further explain the defendant’s reluctance to absorb the plaintiff’s direct and consequential losses relating to non and or late delivery</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, on a consideration <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> all the circumstances, we find that the alleged shortage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> aggregates did not, in any event, fall within the scope and ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. The Plaintiff’s appeal on this issue therefore succeeds. We now turn to the issue <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> whether non- or short supply resulting from <em>plant breakdowns</em> falls within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>force majeure</em> clause (assuming that it had been specifically pleaded).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plant breakdowns</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge held that the non- or short supply due to plant breakdowns did not fall within the scope and ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> because in the event that the Kaki Bukit plant broke down, the Defendant had two back-up plants and two friendly suppliers to accommodate the supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff (see the GD at [95]). The Judge also found that the Defendant was estopped from arguing plant breakdowns to avoid liability because it had represented to the Plaintiff during negotiations that back-up plants were available (see the GD at [98]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On appeal, the Defendant’s main argument was that there was no contractual requirement to provide a back-up plant and, further, that at the time <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the breakdowns, only the Kaki Bukit plant had been approved by the LTA for the supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete for the Project.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the Judge’s finding that in so far as plant breakdowns were concerned, the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> do not apply and the Defendant is accordingly liable for the cost differentials incurred during these occasions. In the first instance, the Defendant has to show (as with the alleged market raw material shortages) that the plant breakdowns were something “beyond the supplier’s control”. Indeed, this requirement is driven home by the fact that in the <em>force majeure</em> clauses themselves, there is the additional appellation “unforeseen” that qualifies “plant breakdowns”. We also reiterate that in order for a defendant to rely on a <em>force majeure</em> clause, it has to show that it has taken all reasonable steps to avoid its operation, or to mitigate its results.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, we find that the Defendant was unable to prove that the plant breakdowns were unforeseen and beyond its control. Indeed, it also had <em>not</em> taken reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a plant breakdown. After the LTA had allowed the Defendant to resume supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete in November 2004, the LTA stipulated that only concrete from the Kaki Bukit plant may be supplied. More importantly, however, the LTA also stated that it should be informed in advance in the event that the need to use other plants belonging to the Defendant should arise. It was thus open to the Defendant, very early on, to avoid or mitigate the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> any breakdown in the Kaki Bukit plant by seeking the LTA’s approval to use the Gay World and Kallang plants. It also followed, therefore, that the opportunity to avoid the event that happened (<em>viz</em>, the plant breakdowns) was <em>clearly within the defendant’s control</em>. However, the Defendant failed to take any steps in this direction and opted, instead, to rely solely on the operation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Kaki Bukit plant. This was not a reasonable cause <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> action to adopt since a plant breakdown must have been a foreseeable event, especially when only one plant was being utilised.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s argument that there was no contractual requirement to provide a back-up plant is misconceived. Where a party seeks to rely on a <em>force majeure</em> clause, the law places a burden on it to satisfy the court that it falls within the scope and ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that clause. In a related vein, the party must also show that there was truly nothing it could have done to avoid the operation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the event or to mitigate its results. This is merely an extension <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the general principle that a party must be strictly held to its contractual obligations and should only be released from them where supervening events make it <em>impossible</em>, and not merely <em>onerous</em>, to fulfil them. As noted at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_57">[57]</a> above, the words “<span class="blueHighlight">frustration</span>” or “<em>force majeure</em>” typically connote some sort <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>impossibility</em> on the defendant’s part to perform his contractual obligations. More importantly, this general principle has been clearly embodied within the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> – in particular, by the need for the Defendant to show that the plant breakdowns were not only “unforeseen” but also (and this, in fact, follows logically) that such breakdowns were “beyond the supplier’s [the Defendant’s] control”. In this regard, the fact that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> may not have provided for all possible eventualities in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> does not, and cannot, extinguish the Defendant’s duty to mitigate the results <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the supervening event.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, <em>even if</em> the Defendant had specifically pleaded circumstances <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em>, it would nevertheless not have been exempted from liability under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. The Defendant’s appeal on this issue is therefore dismissed, whilst the Plaintiff’s appeal is allowed. In the result, we find that the Defendant is liable for <em>all</em> the cost differentials incurred as a result <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> non- or short supply between 18&nbsp;November 2004 and 5&nbsp;April 2005.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue&nbsp;(d) – Was the Defendant entitled to suspend supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete on 5&nbsp;April 2005?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5&nbsp;April 2005, the Defendant suspended its supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete to the Plaintiff due to non-payment for all concrete supplied up to February 2005 and this included the non-payment <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the 5% retention sum.

The Defendant also does not dispute that the Plaintiff is entitled to deduct Item&nbsp;2 and withhold Item&nbsp;7. In particular, cl&nbsp;7 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent allows the Plaintiff to retain 5% <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> all payments due to the Defendant until two months after 30&nbsp;June 2006.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Defendant strongly disputed liability for the 6% administrative charge unilaterally imposed by the Plaintiff (Item&nbsp;5). In a letter sent on 6&nbsp;April 2005 from the Plaintiff to all its sub-contractors, the Defendant was notified that the Plaintiff would impose a 6% administrative charge for additional administrative and accounting work undertaken by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff then proceeded to retrospectively impose the 6% administrative charge on the cost differentials incurred between 7&nbsp;July 2004 and 5&nbsp;April 2005 and deducted the same from the outstanding payments owed to the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the Plaintiff was <em>not</em> entitled to <em>unilaterally</em> or <em>retrospectively</em> impose the 6% administrative charge on the Defendant. Such an administrative charge was not provided for in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> and it was not suggested that it operated as an implied term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Further, no evidence was tendered that the unilateral imposition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> such charges was a market practice. In sum, there was absolutely no basis for the imposition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the administrative charge. As a result, the Plaintiff had wrongfully withheld this sum from the Defendant. On this basis alone, we find that the Defendant was entitled to suspend its supply, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider Items&nbsp;1, 3 and 6 which were not, apparently and in any event, dealt with expressly by the Judge in the GD. The Plaintiff’s appeal on this issue is therefore dismissed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue&nbsp;(e) – Was the Plaintiff entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on 30&nbsp;May 2005?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background and issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30&nbsp;May 2005, pursuant to cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent (set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_8">[8]</a> above), the Plaintiff terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on two grounds:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Defendant had continuously fallen short in supply and/or was unable to supply the concrete when ordered by the Plaintiff; and/or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Defendant’s supply was unable to meet the LTA’s requirements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge held that the Plaintiff was entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on both grounds.

It therefore stands in urgent need <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> clarification, not least in the local context.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">General position at common law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider, first, the general right to terminate a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> for <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> and, secondly, the right to claim damages.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The general right to terminate a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> for <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various situations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the first issue, it is important to note, at the outset, that, in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, there is <em>no automatic</em> legal right conferred on the innocent party to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (<em>viz</em>, the party who is not in <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>) to elect to treat the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> as discharged (<em>ie</em>, to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>). The circumstances under which such a party is entitled to elect to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> at common law depends on which particular situation exists. These situations (<em>shorn <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> more specific and difficult legal issues, as well as special rules with respect to certain specific types <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contracts</span></em>) can be classified into two broad categories. The first broad category is clear and comprises one situation only. The second comprises three situations, the last two <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> which (whilst distinct) may (depending on the precise facts <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the case at hand) conflict with each other. The two broad categories as well as the specific situations therein may be summarised as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> clearly and unambiguously provides for the event or events pursuant to which the innocent party is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>first broad category</em> (“Situation&nbsp;1”) deals with the situation where the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> clearly and unambiguously states that, in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a certain event or events occurring, the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. A <em>clear</em> example <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this is, in fact, cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent in the present appeal (set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Hence, the other situations are not directly applicable in the present appeal. However, for the sake <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> completeness and, more importantly, because this entire area is, as already mentioned, one <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the more significant (yet complex) areas <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the law <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and there is little by way <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> clarification in the local case law, we set out briefly the remaining situations as well.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> does <em>not</em> clearly and unambiguously provide for the event or events pursuant to which the innocent party is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Introduction</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second broad category deals with the situation where the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> does not clearly and unambiguously refer to the right to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (unlike Situation&nbsp;1 above). Under this broad category, there are at least three possible situations under which the innocent party may elect to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. The first (“Situation&nbsp;2”) is separate and distinct from both Situation&nbsp;1 above as well as the other two situations under this broad category (“Situations&nbsp;3(a) and 3(b)”, respectively). The two last-mentioned situations (<em>viz</em>, Situations&nbsp;3(a) and 3(b)), although separate and distinct, may (under certain fact situations) conflict with each other.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Situation&nbsp;2</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>first</em> situation under this broad category (Situation&nbsp;2, overall), where a party, by his words or conduct, simply <em>renounces</em> its <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> inasmuch as it clearly conveys to the other party to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> that it <em>will not perform its contractual obligations at all</em>, that other party (<em>viz</em>, the innocent party to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>) is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that we do not consider here the more complex situation where the party allegedly renouncing the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> <em>bona fide</em> (albeit <em>erroneously</em>) concludes that it was justified in not proceeding with the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (for a recent discussion <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this specific issue, see the Singapore High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>GIB Automation Pte Ltd v Deluge Fire Protection (SEA) Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0918.xml&#39;)">[2007] 2&nbsp;SLR(R) 918</a>, especially at [76]–[77] (and the authorities cited therein – in particular, the leading House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/14094-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1980] 1&nbsp;WLR 277</a>)).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a suggestion in a leading textbook that where a <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> party <em>deliberately</em> chooses and is, indeed, “determined” to perform its part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> “only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations” (<em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Wright in the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Ross T&nbsp;Smyth &amp; Co, Ltd&nbsp;v T&nbsp;D&nbsp;Bailey, Son &amp; Co</em> [1940] 3&nbsp;All&nbsp;ER 60 at 72, which is termed “substantial <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>” by the author) then that, too, will also justify the innocent party’s termination <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (see Sir&nbsp;Guenter Treitel, <em>The Law <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span></em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th&nbsp;Ed, 2003) at p&nbsp;809 (and the authorities cited therein)). With respect, however, and having regard to the substance <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> (and, more importantly, controversy in relationship between) <em>Situations&nbsp;3(a) and 3(b)</em> below, the preferable view, in our opinion, appears to be that whether or not the innocent party is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> concerned will depend, in the final analysis, upon whether or not the tests pursuant to <em>Situations&nbsp;3(a) and 3(b)</em> below are satisfied <em>and in the manner or order proposed below</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge, however, that there is some merit in Prof&nbsp;Treitel’s suggestion inasmuch as it can be argued that if the defaulting party chooses to perform the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> in a manner substantially inconsistent with its contractual obligations, it is, in <em>substance and effect</em>, renouncing the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> concerned. However, not having heard detailed arguments on this point, we will leave it open for further consideration should a suitable occasion arise in the future. It is interesting to note, however, that if the approach proffered below is adopted, the <em>same</em> result would, in <em>substance</em>, be achieved. In other words, and anticipating somewhat in advance the analysis that is to follow, if the party in <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> had <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> a condition <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, the innocent party would be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> but if the party in <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> had <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> a warranty instead, the innocent party would still be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> if there had been a <em>substantial <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span></em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Situation&nbsp;3(a) – condition/warranty approach</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>second</em> situation (Situation&nbsp;3(a)), the focus is on the <em>nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term</em> <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> and, in particular, whether the <em>intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties</em> to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> was <em>to designate that term</em> as one that is <em>so important</em> that <em>any</em> <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>, <em>regardless</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>actual consequences</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> such a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>, would <em>entitle</em> the innocent party to <em>terminate</em> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (this is, however, not to say that the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> are irrelevant inasmuch as the parties have, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, envisaged, in <em>advance</em>, <em>and hypothetically</em>, <em>serious</em> consequences that could ensue in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that particular term). In traditional legal terminology, such a term would be termed a “<em>condition</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, <em>however</em>, the intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties to the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> was to designate that term as one that is <em>not so important</em> so that <em>no</em> <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> will <em>ever</em> entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (<em>even if</em> the <em>actual</em> consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> such a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> are <em>extremely serious</em>), then such a term would be termed a “<em>warranty</em>” (see also, and in a more general vein, the classic exposition by Bowen&nbsp;LJ (as he then was) in the leading English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Bentsen v Taylor, Sons &amp; Co</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/40672-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1893] 2&nbsp;QB 274</a> at 281). This “condition-warranty approach” is in fact (in so far as the sale <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> goods context is concerned) enshrined within the Sale <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Goods Act (Cap&nbsp;393, 1994&nbsp;Rev Ed). It should be mentioned, at this juncture, that the innocent party would (as we shall see below at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_114">[114]</a>) nevertheless be entitled to all the damages that it can establish in law.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Situation&nbsp;3(b) – the</em> Hongkong Fir <em>approach</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>third</em> situation (Situation&nbsp;3(b)), the focus is <em>not</em> (as in the second (Situation&nbsp;3(a) above)) on the nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> (<em>ie</em>, whether it is a “condition” or a “warranty”) but, rather, on <em>the nature and consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span></em>. In particular, where the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> in question will “give rise to an <em>event</em> which <em>will deprive</em> the party not in default [<em>viz</em>, the innocent party] <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>substantially the whole benefit</em> which it was <em>intended</em> that he should obtain from the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>” [emphasis added], then the innocent party is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. The words just quoted are from the oft-cited judgment <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Diplock&nbsp;LJ (as he then was) in the seminal English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/64014-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1962] 2&nbsp;QB 26</a> at 70 (“<em>Hongkong Fir</em>”). Not surprisingly, perhaps, this approach has been termed “the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach”. It is an approach under which the innocent party is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> if the nature and consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> are so serious as to “go to the root <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>” (see the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Suisse Atlantique Société d’Armement Maritime SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/65207-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1967] 1&nbsp;AC 361</a> at 422, <em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Upjohn) and constitutes a “fundamental <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>” <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (see also <em>per</em> Lord&nbsp;Diplock in the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Photo Production Ltd&nbsp;v Securicor Transport Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/67432-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1980] AC&nbsp;827</a> at 849, where the learned law lord also referred to the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the “condition” in the sense referred to in Situation&nbsp;3(a) above).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One main difference between the condition-warranty approach in Situation&nbsp;3(a) and the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach in Situation&nbsp;3(b) should be highlighted. Under the condition-warranty approach, the paramount aim <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the court is to ascertain the parties’ intention in relation to the nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the contractual term <em>in advance</em>, <em>viz</em>, at the time <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span>. The innocent party’s right to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> upon <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> depends wholly on whether the term is classified as a “condition” or a “warranty”. In contrast, the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach requires a confirmation <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the right on the part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> <em>after the fact</em> inasmuch as the parties have to “wait and see” <em>what the nature and consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> actually are</em> (and see the reference by Lord&nbsp;Lowry in the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Bunge Corporation, New York v Tradax Export SA, Panama</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/14434-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1981] 1&nbsp;WLR 711</a> (“<em>Bunge</em>”) at 719 to “[t]he ‘wait and see’ method”). Conceptually, at least, the condition-warranty approach in Situation&nbsp;3(a) above tends more towards (especially commercial) certainty and predictability whilst the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach (on the other hand) tends more towards fairness. This is essentially because the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach prevents a party from terminating the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> on excessively technical grounds in a bid to escape from unfavourable bargains. However, it should also be noted that it is <em>also fair</em> to hold the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties to their bargain (under the condition-warranty approach) and that, therefore, there is no sharp dichotomy as such between certainty and predictability on the one hand and fairness on the other in so far as the two approaches just mentioned are concerned. We will, in fact, elaborate on this more below (at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_102">[102]</a>–<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_110">[110]</a>).

It will, however, not differ much from the one set out in the preceding paragraph, save that it would embody clarification <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the relationship between Situation&nbsp;3(a) and Situation&nbsp;3(b).

Indeed, there could be fact situations where the application <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> either approach would make <em>no difference</em>.

Take, for example, a situation where there is a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>condition</em> (which would entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> under the condition-warranty approach) <em>but</em> which <em>simultaneously</em> results in <em>very trivial consequences only</em> (which would <em>not</em> entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> under the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach). In contrast, take another situation where there is a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>warranty</em> (which would <em>not</em> entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> under the condition-warranty approach) <em>but</em> which <em>simultaneously</em> results in <em>the deprivation vis-à-vis the innocent party <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> substantially the whole benefit</em> that it was intended that the innocent party should obtain from the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (which <em>would</em> entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> under the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The added complexity is that the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach is often thought <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> as applying to a term which is <em>neither</em> a condition <em>nor</em> a warranty, but which is (instead) an <em>intermediate or hybrid</em> term (hereafter referred to as an “<em>intermediate</em>” term, although, on other occasions, the nomenclature “<em>innominate</em>” term is used: see, for example, the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decisions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Bunge</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_100">[100]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em> at 726); <em>Torvald Klaveness A/S v Arni Maritime Corporation</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/18806-E-M.xml&#39;)">[1994] 1&nbsp;WLR 1465</a> (“<em>The Gregos</em>”) at 1476; as well as the English Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal decisions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Alfred McAlpine Plc v BAI (Run-Off) Ltd</em> [2000] 1&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 437 at [32] and <em>The Seaflower</em> [2001] 1&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep 341 at [13] and [63]). On occasion, the nomenclature “intermediate” term and “innominate” term are used interchangeably (see, for example, <em>Bunge</em> (at 717) and <em>The Seaflower</em> (at [15]); as Lord&nbsp;Lowry aptly put it in <em>Bunge</em> (at&nbsp;719):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is “intermediate” because it lies in the middle <em>between</em> a condition and a warranty (just as the remedy for its <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> lies somewhere between the remedies for <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a condition and <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a warranty), and it is “innominate” because it is not <em>called</em> a condition or a warranty but assumes the character <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> each in turn. [emphasis in original]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <em>intermediate</em> term is, as an integral part <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach, defined (unlike the condition or warranty) <em>not</em> by reference to the <em>nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span></em> but, rather, by reference to the <em>actual consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span></em> (what Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce termed in <em>Bunge</em> ( at 716) as “the ‘gravity <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>’ approach”). More specifically, an intermediate term is defined as one which is <em>neither</em> a condition <em>nor</em> a warranty simply because a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> it <em>could give rise to either very substantial or to very trivial consequences</em>. Unfortunately, however, such an approach <em>effectively and practically obliterates</em> the distinction between a condition and a warranty because the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>virtually any term</em> could give rise to either very substantial or to very trivial consequences (and see the observations by Megaw&nbsp;LJ at the Court <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Appeal stage <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Bunge</em> in <em>Bunge Corpn v Tradax&nbsp;SA</em> [1981] 2&nbsp;All&nbsp;ER 513 at 537). In other words, a wholesale adoption <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach in the manner just described would result in its <em>complete eclipse</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the condition-warranty approach. We are <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the view, however, that this should <em>not</em> be the case. There is an appropriate legal role for <em>both</em> approaches. Let us elaborate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether an innocent party is entitled to terminate a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> upon <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>, the <em>foremost</em> consideration is (and must be) <em>to give effect to the intentions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties</em>. If so, then the condition-warranty approach must <em>take precedence</em> over the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach because (as we have seen at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_100">[100]</a> above), it is premised on the intentions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties themselves. Thus, in <em>Bunge</em> (at 716), Lord&nbsp;Wilberforce expressly cautioned that the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach would be <em>unsuitable</em> in cases where the parties had evinced an intention that the contractual obligation was to have the force <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a condition. In such cases, regardless <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span>, the innocent party would be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> is a <em>warranty</em>, we are <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the view that the innocent party is not thereby prevented from terminating the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (as it would have been entitled so to do if the condition-warranty approach operated <em>alone</em>). Considerations <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>fairness</em> demand, in our view, that the <em>consequences</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> should <em>also</em> be examined by the court, <em>even if</em> the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> is only a warranty (as opposed to a condition). There would, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> course, be no need for the court to examine the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> if the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> was a <em>condition</em> since, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a condition would (as we have just stated) entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> in the first instance. Hence, it is only in a situation where the term <span class="blueHighlight">breached</span> would otherwise constitute a <em>warranty</em> that the court would, as a question <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>fairness</em>, go <em>further</em> and examine the <em>consequences</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> as well. In the result, if the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> are such as to deprive the innocent party <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>substantially the whole benefit</em> that it was intended that the innocent party should obtain from the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, then the innocent party <em>would</em> be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, <em>notwithstanding</em> that it only constitutes a <em>warranty</em>. If, however, the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> are only <em>very trivial</em>, then the innocent party would <em>not</em> be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the approach adopted in the preceding paragraph would, <em>in effect</em>, result in the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>warranty</em>, as we know it, being effectively effaced since there would virtually <em>never</em> be a situation in which there would be a term, the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> which would <em>always</em> result in <em>only trivial consequences</em>. In other words, if a term was not a condition under the condition-warranty approach, it would necessarily become an <em>intermediate</em> term, subject to the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach (see, in this regard, the perceptive observations by Robert Goff&nbsp;J (as he then was) in the English High Court decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>The Ymnos</em> [1982] 2&nbsp;Lloyd’s&nbsp;Rep&nbsp;574 at 583). In other words, the traditional three-fold classification <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> contractual terms (comprising conditions, warranties and intermediate terms, respectively) would be a merely theoretical one only. <em>However</em>, the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the intermediate term was itself only fully developed <em>many years after</em> the condition-warranty approach (in <em>Hongkong Fir</em>). Further, and more importantly (from a practical perspective), it should also be observed that the <em>spirit</em> behind the concept <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the warranty would <em>still remain</em> in appropriate fact situations inasmuch as the innocent party would not be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> if the consequences <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> were found to be trivial (although it would, as we shall see, be entitled to damages that it could establish at law). As importantly, this last-mentioned result, <em>viz</em>, the right to claim damages, is precisely that which would have obtained, in any event, had the court found that the term concerned was a warranty under the condition-warranty approach.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, the approach which seems to us to be most appropriate (and as set out at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_106">[106]</a>–<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_107">[107]</a> above) not only integrates the condition-warranty approach and the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach in their formal aspects but also achieves a judicious balance between predictability and certainty on the one hand and fairness on the other.

It is nevertheless an important one which bears reiteration especially since it also completes the present analysis <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the general law relating to <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. To reiterate, even if the innocent party is not entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>, it will <em>always</em> be entitled, subject to any applicable legal conditions or constraints (such as the need to prove substantive damage, as well as the legal rules and principles relating to mitigation, remoteness <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> damages and limitation), to claim <em>damages as <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> right</em> for loss resulting from the <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> (or <span class="blueHighlight">breaches</span>) <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>. It is equally important to emphasise that the innocent party is entitled to claim damages as <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> right even if it is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> and in fact terminates it – subject, again, to any applicable legal conditions or constraints.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">A preliminary analysis</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn, now, to apply the abovementioned principles to the facts <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the present appeal in relation to issue&nbsp;(e).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As already mentioned, the situation in the present case falls within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Situation&nbsp;1</em> above inasmuch as cl&nbsp;8 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent <em>expressly</em> states, <em>inter alia</em>, that “<em>[i]n the event that</em> [the Defendant’s] supply is unable to meet LTA’s requirements, <em>or</em> [the Defendant is] unable to continue [its] supply, <em>[the Plaintiff] reserves the right to terminate [the Defendant’s] <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span></em> and retain and use both the retention sum and any outstanding payment due to [the Defendant] to seek for alternative source <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply” [emphasis added].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly, there is <em>no</em> reference in cl&nbsp;8 with respect to the seriousness <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>consequences</em> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the defendant’s failure <em>vis-à-vis</em> either or both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the events mentioned therein. In any event, the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach in Situation&nbsp;3(b) above is <em>not</em> relevant because <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the express reference to the right to terminate in cl&nbsp;8 itself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also significant to note that, strictly speaking, cl&nbsp;8 has the <em>same substantive</em> effect as a condition under the condition-warranty approach in Situation&nbsp;3(a) above. <em>However</em>, it is <em>different</em> from a condition, strictly so called, because it <em>expressly provides</em> that the innocent party (here, the Plaintiff) is entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> upon the happening <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the stated events. In a typical situation where the condition-warranty approach is invoked, it is usually <em>unclear</em> what the <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span> parties’ intentions are with respect to the nature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that particular term, <em>viz</em>, whether, in the event <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a <span class="blueHighlight">breach</span> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> that term, the term is regarded by the parties as so serious as to entitle the innocent party to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> (<em>ie</em>, that the term is to be a <em>condition</em>), or <em>vice versa</em> (in which case the term is to be a <em>warranty</em>). Clause&nbsp;8 requires <em>no</em> such inquiry; it is <em>clear</em> that the innocent party can terminate provided that there has been a failure by the defendant <em>vis-à-vis</em> either or both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the events mentioned therein.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains to be observed that cl&nbsp;8 does <em>not</em> fall within the ambit <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Situation&nbsp;2 above because the Defendant had clearly <em>not</em> renounced the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> inasmuch as it had <em>not</em> announced to the Plaintiff that it would not perform its (the Defendant’s) contractual obligations <em>at all</em>. Indeed, even after the Defendant suspended supply <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete on 5&nbsp;April 2005, it maintained that it was ready to resume supply as soon as the Plaintiff paid the outstanding amounts allegedly due to the Defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn now to the specific grounds stipulated in cl&nbsp;8 itself. As already noted above, if either or both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the grounds stipulated in that particular clause exist on the facts, the Plaintiff would clearly be entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> (pursuant to <em>Situation&nbsp;1</em> above).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s inability to supply</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the first ground, the Judge found, in essence, that there were several instances where the Defendant had failed to provide alternative dates and timings to the Plaintiff when it could not fulfil the Plaintiff’s orders (see the GD at [121]). Since the Defendant would (or should) have known that it was unable to fulfil the Plaintiff’s orders on the day <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> casting itself, the Judge held that the onus was on the Defendant to inform the Plaintiff <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the non-supply when the Plaintiff confirmed its orders.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On appeal before us, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff was not entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> because, <em>as at 30&nbsp;May 2005</em>, the Defendant was in fact able to continue supply under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>, but did not do so because it had, on 5&nbsp;April 2005, suspended supply <em>on the basis <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s non-payment</em>. Further, the plant breakdowns were only sporadic and temporary in nature, and lasted for a very short period each time. In essence, the Defendant argued that it could clearly continue its supply as long as the Plaintiff paid its outstanding debts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defendant’s argument is clearly misconceived because the Defendant’s suspension <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply due to non-payment was <em>not</em> the basis on which the Plaintiff invoked cl&nbsp;8. Instead, the Plaintiff relied on the fact that, between November 2004 and March 2005, there were numerous occasions on which the Defendant failed to supply concrete pre-ordered by the Plaintiff. Further, there were many instances in which the Defendant neither gave reasons for the non- or short supply nor provided alternative delivery dates and times. A quick perusal <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the numerous complaints registered by the Plaintiff would show that the breakdowns were not as “temporary” or “sporadic” as the Defendant claimed. In fact, we have noted above that the Defendant had failed on <em>no fewer than 42 occasions</em> to supply the concrete ordered by the Plaintiff. Returning to the precise language <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>, cl&nbsp;8 affords the right <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> termination to the Plaintiff when the Defendant was “unable to <em>continue</em>” [emphasis added] its supply. Clearly, the word “continue” connotes uninterrupted supply. In our view, the sporadic interruptions constituted non-continuous and interrupted supply that would therefore entitle the Plaintiff to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, counsel for the Defendant, Mr&nbsp;Por, strenuously advanced the argument that the Defendant’s <em>sole</em> obligation under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was to supply 70,000m<sup>3</sup> <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> cement during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period. The implication <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> this argument is that the Defendant would be absolved from all liability arising from the occasions on which it was unable to supply the concrete ordered by the Plaintiff during the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> period. This was because, as Mr&nbsp;Por argued, there was no “priority term” in the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> and thus the Plaintiff was not entitled to priority supply. The Plaintiff would have to take its place in the queue with the Defendant’s other customers and would be supplied on a first come, first served basis. Mr&nbsp;Por argued that where the Defendant had insufficient concrete to supply to the Plaintiff, it was always open to the Plaintiff to purchase concrete from alternative suppliers <em>at its own cost</em>, and the Defendant should not be liable for any cost differentials resulting therefrom.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, we are unable to accept this argument. At the outset, we note that scant evidence was tendered to demonstrate the existence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the alleged queue system and, even if it existed, whether it was strictly adhered to. In the trial court, only oral evidence was led and there was a conspicuous lack <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> documentary evidence as to how the Defendant processed its orders daily. We therefore entertain grave doubts with regard to the Defendant’s argument, and question whether the Defendant had chosen, instead, to supply concrete to other customers who were willing to pay a higher price over supplying to the Plaintiff, who enjoyed preferential fixed rates under the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span>. Indeed, the Judge noted that the Defendant offered “rock bottom prices” to the Plaintiff and suffered a “budgeted loss” on the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> (see the GD at [137], reproduced at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_74">[74]</a> above). It is therefore unsurprising that the Defendant would be reluctant to absorb the Plaintiff’s direct losses relating to non- or short supply.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even if we accept the existence <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> a queue system, as a matter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> business efficacy or based on the test <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the officious bystander, it must have been an implied term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> that, subject to circumstances <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>force majeure</em> and notwithstanding the queue system implemented by the Defendant, the Defendant was contractually obliged to satisfy the orders placed by the Plaintiff for the purchase <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> concrete in a <em>timely</em> fashion. It could not have been the intention <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the parties that the Plaintiff would literally be at the “mercy” <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Defendant’s queue system and have to turn to alternative suppliers at its own expense each and every time the Plaintiff “lost” its priority in the Defendant’s queue system, especially since the Plaintiff was working according to parameters laid down by the LTA. Indeed, we find it inconceivable that any party in the Plaintiff’s position would enter into such a <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> on such a basis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As no unassailable objective evidence was tendered to prove that the Defendant truly could not supply the Plaintiff’s requirements because the Plaintiff was at the “back <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the queue”, we express concern that the Defendant was allocating supply to the Plaintiff on an arbitrary basis. Indeed, in each <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the 42 instances that the Defendant failed to supply the Plaintiff’s orders, there was no documentary evidence showing the Plaintiff’s position in the Defendant’s queue. Indeed, if the Defendant’s queue system was strictly implemented, there had to come a point in time when the Plaintiff’s orders reached the front <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the queue. Yet, no evidence was produced as to the outcome <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s orders that were at the “back <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the queue” and were hence not fulfilled.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s inability to meet the LTA’s requirements</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the second ground, it was a term <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> that the concrete supplied by the Defendant should comply with the LTA’s standards. Clause&nbsp;3 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Not withstanding [<em>sic</em>] the Terms and Conditions <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Supply in your quotation, you are fully aware and will comply with LTA’s latest revision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Materials and Workmanship Specification for Civil and Structural Works at no extra cost.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA’s specifications are contained under ch&nbsp;11 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <em>Materials and Workmanship Specification for Civil and Structual Works</em> (Land Transport Authority, Revision&nbsp;A4, September 2001) (“LTA Materials Specification”). Clause&nbsp;11.5.5 provides that cubes from the trial batches shall be tested at an age <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 28 days. The average strength <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the cubes tested at 28 days shall exceed the specified characteristic strength by at least 7N/mm<sup>2</sup>. Clause&nbsp;11.12.3 provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The temperature differential between the warmer interior portion and the cooler surface portion <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the thick element shall be limited to prevent early thermal cracking due to heat <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> hydration … The maximum temperature within the element shall not exceed 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA therefore required concrete to pass the strength tests at 28 days and at a peak core temperature below 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, cl&nbsp;4 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the Plaintiff’s letter <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> intent also provides as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You guarantee that the temperature control criteria will be met with the use <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> PBFC concrete with chilled water as offered in your quotation, whether it is for 28 or 56 days strength mix. Layer concreting to meet the criteria is not acceptable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests conducted on concrete supplied by the Defendant for 56 days strength passed the requisite peak core temperature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C. The mixes, however, failed to pass the test for concrete <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 28 days strength. The Plaintiff’s case was that, up till 30&nbsp;May 2005, the Defendant was still unable to comply with the LTA’s requirements. It therefore terminated the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on this ground. The Judge held that the Plaintiff had discharged its burden <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> proving that it was entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> (see the GD at [134] and [135]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Defendant, the requirements <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C and 28 days strength could only be achieved in concrete slabs <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> “normal” thickness (which was defined by the Defendant as being up to 500mm). The Defendant argued, first, that these requirements were incompatible and impractical for thick slabs which the Plaintiff required to be cast (about 2,000mm). It emphasised that it was only informed <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the thickness <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the slabs <em>after</em> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was formed. Notably, the Defendant proposed to change the peak core temperature to 80<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C but this was rejected by the LTA. Secondly, it also argued that, as the LTA had later agreed to accept concrete that passed the 56 days strength test, the Defendant was therefore no longer under any contractual obligation to meet the 28 days strength requirement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are unable to accept the Defendant’s argument. The terms <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> are clear. Clause&nbsp;3 incorporates the LTA’s specifications, which specifically requires the Defendant to satisfy the strength test at 28 days and 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C peak core temperature. It is trite that contractual liability is strict. In general, it is immaterial why the defendant failed to fulfil its obligation; it certainly could not plead the defence that it had done its best: see the House <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Lords decision <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <em>Raineri v Miles</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_40">[40]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em> at 1086). On the facts, we reject the Defendant’s arguments that the LTA specifications were impractical or even impossible for three reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the evidence was that alternative concrete suppliers such as Pan United and Island Concrete Pte Ltd were able to comply with both <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the LTA specifications. Chan Ying Wah, who was the general manager <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> Pan United, confirmed in his affidavit that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Pan United was able to comply with LTA’s specification for concrete strength 28 days and 56 days at peak temperature not exceeding 70 degree celsius. Pan United had supplied concrete complying wit this requirement to Sato Kogyo.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Defendant’s argument that it was unaware that the concrete was to be used to construct thick slabs is, with respect, spurious. Paragraph&nbsp;11.12 <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the LTA Materials Specification (under which can be found para&nbsp;11.12.3 which provides for a peak core temperature <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> 70<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">°</font>C) is titled “CONCRETING <span class="blueHighlight">OF</span> THICK SECTIONS”. Further, the Defendant knew that the concrete was required for the construction <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> an underground MRT station and, as experienced participants in the industry, would have foreseen that concrete slabs <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> considerable thickness would need to be cast accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, evidence was given during cross-examination that it was not standard industry practice for contractors to provide concrete suppliers with construction drawings showing the specific structural elements to be cast at the time the <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span> is signed. The usual terms discussed typically concern concrete volume, period <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> supply and temperature control requirements. The Defendant’s excuse that it was not notified, at the time <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> <span class="blueHighlight">contracting</span>, <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the thickness <span class="blueHighlight">of</span> the structural slabs is thus without basis as there was generally no practice or requirement for the Plaintiff to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we affirm the Judge’s decision that the Plaintiff was entitled to terminate the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> on the grounds that the Defendant was unable to meet the LTA’s requirements and that it was unable to continue its supply.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as issue&nbsp;(a) (at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[2007]%204%20SLR(R)%200413.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_14">[14]</a> above) is concerned, we affirm the Judge’s decision that the <span class="blueHighlight">Contract</span> was not an exclusive or sole supplier <span class="blueHighlight">contract</span>.
