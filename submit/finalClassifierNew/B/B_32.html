A more purposive construction should be adopted and such power was necessarily implied in s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>) of the CPC.

court):</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court has reserved for decision of this court two questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest which had arisen in the course of an appeal before it, the determination of which had affected the event of the appeal. The questions are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the High Court, exercising its appellate criminal jurisdiction, has the power to amend a charge pursuant to s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (Cap&nbsp;68); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether a fresh consent of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> is required when a charge preferred under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap&nbsp;241) is amended by the appellate court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant facts that gave rise to the questions before us are these. The applicants, who were the appellants (“the appellants”), were at the material time police officers. Before the District Court, the first appellant was charged with having corruptly accepted from one Barlly Tan Kim Hock a gratification of a sum of $2,000 as an inducement to recommend that no further action be taken on a complaint against one Leong Kin Eng which the first appellant was then investigating, an offence punishable under s&nbsp;6(<em>a</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap&nbsp;241, 1993 Ed) (“the Act”). The second appellant was charged with having abetted the first appellant in the commission of that offence by arranging for Barlly Tan Kim Hock to give the money to the first appellant, an offence punishable under s&nbsp;29(<em>a</em>) read with s&nbsp;6(<em>a</em>) of the Act. They both claimed trial to their respective charges and were tried jointly. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the respective charges against the appellants were, on application by the Prosecution, amended by the addition of alternative charges against the appellants respectively, and fresh consents from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> were tendered in respect of the alternative charges. Except for the date on which the offences were alleged to have been committed, the alternative charges were exactly the same as the charges originally framed. The learned district judge called upon the appellants to enter upon their defence on the amended charges and the appellants each gave evidence in their defence. At the close of the case, the learned district judge found them guilty of the alternative charges respectively and convicted them accordingly. The appellants were each sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $2,000 and in default of payment to serve a term of imprisonment of one month.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against their convictions and sentences, they appealed to the High Court. Their appeals were heard before Yong Pung How&nbsp;CJ. In a reserved judgment, reported in <em>Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1995] 3 SLR(R) 0453.xml&#39;)">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 453</a>, the learned Chief Justice dismissed their appeals. The learned Chief Justice held, <em>inter alia</em>, that the district judge erred in allowing the Prosecution to amend the charges by adding the alternative charges against the appellants respectively. He opined that these charges gave rise to a suggestion that there were two separate offences of corruption on the two different dates, namely, 6 and 10&nbsp;July&nbsp;1991, when it was clear that the appellants were each being prosecuted in respect of only one offence of corruption which was alleged to have taken place on either of the two dates. The alternative charges were only introduced because the Prosecution was unable to pinpoint the precise date when the offence of corruption took place. The learned Chief Justice amended the original charges by adding an alternative date of 10&nbsp;July to the existing date of 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;1991 in respect of both the appellants and eliminated the alternative charges. In doing so, he held that fresh consent from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> was not necessary. In amending the charges the learned Chief Justice invoked the court’s powers under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (Cap&nbsp;68) (“CPC”). We shall refer to this provision in greater detail shortly. As amended, each charge averred that the offence took place “on or about the 6th or the 10th day of July 1991”. The appellants were convicted on the amended charges and their sentences were maintained.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the judgment was delivered, counsel for the appellants made an oral application for the two questions to be reserved for determination by this court under s&nbsp;60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act as questions of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> of <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal, the determination of which had affected the event of the appeal. The application was allowed by the learned Chief Justice, and hence the questions have come before this court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question (1): The High Court’s power to amend a charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn first to s&nbsp;256 of the CPC which sets out the powers of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. This section, in so far as relevant, provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may —</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an appeal from a conviction —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly there is no express power conferred by these provisions on the High Court to amend the charge at the hearing of an appeal from the court below. There are two previous decisions to the effect that the High Court in exercising its appellate jurisdiction has no power under this section to amend the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Quek Ching Kim v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33346-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] MLJ&nbsp;54</a>, the accused was convicted before the Magistrate’s Court of an offence against s&nbsp;4(<em>c</em>) of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. On appeal to the High Court, a point was taken that the charge was erroneously worded and did not disclose an offence against s&nbsp;4(<em>c</em>). That was conceded by counsel for the Crown; and it was further conceded by him that he was not entitled to ask the appellate court to amend the charge at that stage. Whyatt&nbsp;CJ, who heard the appeal, agreed with counsel. The learned Chief Justice said, at 54:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the Crown did not seek to press the point that he was entitled to ask the appellate court to amend the charge at the appellate stage. In adopting this attitude counsel for the Crown stated that he was influenced by the fact that sub-s&nbsp;(2) of s&nbsp;156 [now s&nbsp;163] of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code provided that any amendment to a charge should be read and explained to the accused, but since on appeal the accused was not necessarily present, it seemed to follow that the intention was that such amendments could only be made during the proceedings before a magistrate.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agreed with the view of counsel for the Crown that the charge as worded did not disclose any offence and it was now too late to amend it so as to bring it within the provisions of s&nbsp;4(<em>c</em>) of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. I accordingly allowed the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Wee Toon Boon v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1974-1976] SLR(R) 0761.xml&#39;)">[1974–1976] SLR(R) 761</a>, the accused was convicted before the District Court of five charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. On appeal to the High Court, it was argued on his behalf and conceded by the Prosecution that the fourth charge had not been made out and ought to be set aside. The Prosecution then invited the court to act under s&nbsp;246 (now s&nbsp;256) of the CPC and substitute “a conviction on the original fourth charge”. Wee Chong Jin&nbsp;CJ declined to do so. He said, at [44]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The powers of this court sitting as an appellate court are statutory and clearly s&nbsp;246 [now s&nbsp;256] gives no power on appeal to alter or amend a charge and accordingly the conviction and sentence on the amended fourth charge cannot stand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, it seems to us that strictly speaking the Prosecution was not asking the court to amend the charge; the Prosecution was asking the court to alter the finding made below and in consequence to substitute a conviction of an offence with which he had not been charged for the conviction of the fourth charge which could not be sustained. That, on the authorities which we shall discuss in a moment, the court has power to do under s&nbsp;246.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (FMS Cap&nbsp;6) contains provisions very similar to those of s&nbsp;256 of the CPC, and the relevant provisions are in the following terms:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">316&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing of the appeal the Judge may, if he considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an appeal from a conviction or in an appeal as to sentence (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried or committed for trial; or (ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or with or without altering the finding reduce or enhance the sentence or alter the nature of the sentence;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian courts have followed <em>Quek Ching Kim</em>. In <em>Lee Swee Tee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33829-M.xml&#39;)">[1960] MLJ&nbsp;161</a>, the accused was charged with assisting in the “management” of a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> lottery contrary to the provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance 1953 and was convicted. On appeal to the High Court, Rigby J held that the charge did not disclose an offence and was bad in <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. He held that the accused, on the facts, could and should have been charged with the offence of assisting in carrying on a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> lottery, and said, at 161:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have seriously considered whether in the interests of justice I ought not to amend the charge at this stage and, on the facts, convict the appellant of what would have been the correct charge of assisting in carrying on a <span class="blueHighlight">public</span> lottery. But the same point fell for consideration before Whyatt&nbsp;CJ, in the Singapore case of <em>Quek Ching Kim v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33346-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] MLJ&nbsp;54</a>. His Lordship in that case agreed with the attitude taken by counsel for the Crown that having regard to the provisions of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code before any amendment to a charge was made such amendment should be read and explained to the accused who should be called upon to plead to the charge as amended. His Lordship, agreeing with the view taken by counsel for the Crown in that appeal, held that it was then too late to amend the charge so as to bring it within the provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. In the result, unsatisfactory as it may be, I must hold that the trial and conviction in this case was a nullity and that the conviction must accordingly be quashed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Yoong Hock Pin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/37468-M.xml&#39;)">[1977] 1&nbsp;MLJ 178</a>, the accused was charged with criminal breach of trust of a sum of $1,411.25 and the President of the Sessions Court found that some money had been handed to the appellant which had not been accounted for and convicted the accused. On appeal the High Court entertained some doubts as to the actual sum handed over to the accused and found that the money received by him was $392.21 and accordingly he varied the conviction to one of criminal breach of trust of that sum. He then reserved certain questions for the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia. The Federal Court held, <em>inter alia</em>, that it was not competent for the learned judge on appeal to amend the charge following the decision in <em>Quek Ching Kim</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, a literal construction of the relevant statutory provision was adopted. On the basis of such construction, the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, would have no power to amend the charge. On the other hand, there are at least two cases where the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction amended the charge. The first is the case of <em>Lew Cheok Hin v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33402-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] MLJ&nbsp;131</a>, which was decided by Taylor&nbsp;J of the High Court of Singapore. There, the accused was tried on three charges of cheating under s&nbsp;420 of the Penal Code (Ord&nbsp;4 of 1871), each alleging that he obtained delivery of the jewellery by tendering a false cheque. At the close of the case, the Prosecution submitted that the offences proved were cheating under s&nbsp;417 of the Code. The district judge convicted the accused under that section in respect of each of the charges. The district judge considered that an offence under s&nbsp;417 was a “minor” offence as compared to that under s&nbsp;420 and he could therefore convict the accused of the offence under s&nbsp;417 without amending the charge by virtue of s&nbsp;168(2) (now s&nbsp;175(2)) of the CPC. On appeal to the High Court, it was argued on behalf of the accused, and conceded by the Prosecution, that the view entertained by the district judge was erroneous; but the Prosecution submitted that the trial court was authorised to convict the accused of a different offence, without amendment of the charge, under s&nbsp;166 (now s&nbsp;172) of the CPC. Taylor&nbsp;J held, first, that on the facts before him the offence under s&nbsp;417 was not a “minor” offence compared to the one under s&nbsp;420, and the trial court had convicted the accused of an offence composed of different particulars and that was not authorised by s&nbsp;168(2). He held, secondly, that s&nbsp;166 dealt with an entirely different situation, and laid down two tests in applying that section. He said, at 134:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are two main tests. First, the facts must be such that the unframed charge was available from the start and could have been framed and tried concurrently under s&nbsp;165; secondly, the evidence must have been presented in such a way as to raise all the same issues of fact as would have been raised had the unframed charge been framed and trial claimed on it. Not only must the evidence for the prosecution be the same but the court must be satisfied that the evidence for the defence would also have been the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the tests to the case before him, the learned judge held that the actual conviction by the court below could not be supported under s&nbsp;166. However, he held that the charges could and should have been amended below before the close of the case for the Prosecution. He then amended the charges during the hearing of the appeal and the amended charges were explained to the accused who claimed trial. His counsel then applied to recall three witnesses for further cross-examination on the amended charges, and that was allowed. The witnesses were recalled and were further cross-examined. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned judge found their evidence consistent and was satisfied that the offences finally charged had been established and he convicted the accused accordingly. Although he considered in some depth the powers of the court in convicting the accused of an offence with which the accused had not been charged, he did not consider the question of the power of the court at the appellate stage to amend the charge. He proceeded on the basis that he had the power to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case is a Malaysian case, <em>Siah Ik Kow v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/35661-M.xml&#39;)">[1968] 2&nbsp;MLJ 217</a>. There, the accused was convicted by the magistrate of two charges, the first of using a motor car for carriage of goods for trade without a haulage permit and the second of so using the motor car without the relevant policy of insurance. The second charge, however, was expressed to be under a certain statutory provision, which did not exist. Chang Min Tat&nbsp;J at the hearing of the appeal amended that charge by correcting the reference to the relevant statutory provision. He said, at 217:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is of course no section or r&nbsp;74(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks) Rules 1959 published under LN169 of 1959. Clearly the offence alleged to be committed came under s&nbsp;74(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance and was punishable under s&nbsp;74(2). No objection was taken to the charge either at the trial or at the appeal. In the circumstances of the case and in particular having regard to the fact that the appellant was not misled, the mistake had not occasioned any failure of justice and I now amend the second charge to bring it under s&nbsp;74(1) and s&nbsp;74(2) of the Road Traffic Ordinance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judge also did not consider the question whether he had the power to amend the charge; he proceeded on the basis that he was empowered to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now revert to the decision of the learned Chief Justice in the instant case. The learned Chief Justice declined to follow the two previous decisions of the High Court of Singapore: <em>Quek Ching Kim</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_7">[7]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) and <em>Wee Toon Boon</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_8">[8]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). He held that the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has the express power under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the CPC to alter the finding made by the court below and on the basis of that power the High Court in several cases had suggested that it could alter the findings and convict the accused on a “substituted charge”: <em>Ng Ee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/31935-M.xml&#39;)">[1941] MLJ&nbsp;180</a>; <em>Lim Teck Seng v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33442-M.xml&#39;)">[1957] MLJ&nbsp;71</a>; <em>Sivalingam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/38832-M.xml&#39;)">[1982] 2&nbsp;MLJ 172</a> and <em>Periasamy v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/42098-M.xml&#39;)">[1993] 2&nbsp;MLJ 551</a>. He said, at [88]–[89]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am mindful that neither the Prosecution nor the Defence has voiced any objection to an amendment to the charges, save that the Defence contends that the Attorney-General’s fresh consent is required. I have already clarified my views on this contention. I should state nonetheless that in doing so, I respectfully decline to follow the decisions of <em>Quek Ching Kim v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33346-M.xml&#39;)">[1956] MLJ&nbsp;54</a> and <em>Wee Toon Boon v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1974-1976] SLR(R) 0761.xml&#39;)">[1974–1976] SLR(R) 761</a>. In these cases, it was held that the High Court, acting in its appellate capacity, could not amend the charge. In <em>Wee Toon Boon</em>, no reasons were given for Wee Chong Jin&nbsp;CJ’s ruling. In <em>Quek Ching Kim</em>, it was conceded by the Prosecution that the court could not convict the accused on an amended charge. Whyatt&nbsp;CJ agreed that this was because s&nbsp;156 (now s&nbsp;163) CPC requires the amended charge to be read and explained to the accused, and it was not necessarily the case that the accused would be present on appeal. It appears that Whyatt&nbsp;CJ’s concern was because the accused might then wish to tailor his evidence to the amended charge or to adduce fresh evidence or recall witnesses.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect, the reason given in <em>Quek Ching Kim</em> is not persuasive. Where a custodial sentence is involved, the accused is bonded to appear in the High Court whenever he lodges an appeal against his conviction. There is thus no question of his absence from the High Court when his appeal is being heard, unless the sentence was a fine only. Furthermore, there are authorities which suggest that the High Court may ‘alter the finding’ pursuant to the current s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) CPC and convict the appellant on a substituted charge (see <em>Ng Ee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/31935-M.xml&#39;)">[1941] MLJ&nbsp;180</a>, <em>Lim Teck Seng v R</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/33442-M.xml&#39;)">[1957] MLJ&nbsp;71</a>, <em>Sivalingam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/38832-M.xml&#39;)">[1982] 2&nbsp;MLJ 172</a>, and <em>Periasamy v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/42098-M.xml&#39;)">[1993] 2&nbsp;MLJ 551</a>). It is hard to see why the High Court may not also ‘alter the finding’ by convicting on an amended charge. After all, substituting a charge surely has more far-reaching consequences than amending a charge. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned Chief Justice drew support for his conclusion from the Malaysian cases. It is necessary to examine these cases in some detail. In <em>Ng Ee v PP</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_17">[17]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) the accused, an omnibus conductor, was charged with and was convicted of having caused the omnibus under his charge to be used in contravention of the condition of the licence in respect of such vehicle by conveying 17 instead of 16 passengers, an offence under s&nbsp;80(6) of the Road Traffic Enactment. On appeal, Cussen&nbsp;J held that the evidence on which the charge was based in no way indicated or supported such an offence. The Prosecution, however, applied to the court to alter the conviction to one of an offence under rr&nbsp;3 and 65 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> Service Vehicles (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment and Use) Rules 1937, submitting that the facts before the court proved that an offence under these rules had been committed. Cussen&nbsp;J after examining the evidence found that that offence had not been proved. He therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction. In the course of his judgment in dealing with the application by the Prosecution to substitute a conviction for the one under appeal, he said, at 181:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, the provisions of s&nbsp;316(b) of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (Cap&nbsp;6) [which was the equivalent of s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>) of our CPC] which empower this court in an appeal from a magistrate’s court to ‘alter the finding …’ do allow of the substitution of a conviction under a different provision of the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> for the conviction found by the magistrate, to substitute the right section for the wrong section. It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same – that the Prosecution evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused’s defence the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Cussen&nbsp;J said there is in substance what Taylor&nbsp;J had said but in somewhat more precise language in the passage of the latter’s judgment in <em>Lew Cheok Hin</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_13">[13]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>) which we have quoted above. We agree in principle with what Cussen&nbsp;J said on the caution to be exercised in substituting a conviction for the one under appeal. However, the learned judge, with respect, appeared to be confusing the power of the court to alter a finding made by the court below with the power to substitute a charge for that which had been preferred against the accused in the court below. There was no question before him of substitution of one charge for another. The court below found that the offence under s&nbsp;80(6) of the Road Traffic Enactment had been committed and convicted the accused accordingly. That conviction was unsustainable on the evidence. The Prosecution then invoked the court’s power under s&nbsp;316(6) and asked the court to find that the accused had committed an offence against rr&nbsp;3 and 65 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> Service Vehicles (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment and Use) Rules, <em>ie</em> to alter the finding below, and accordingly to substitute a conviction of the latter offence for that under appeal. The basis for this is clearly that under ss&nbsp;167, 168 and 169 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (Cap&nbsp;6) [the equivalents of ss&nbsp;173, 174 and 175 of our CPC] the trial court in certain circumstances could, on the evidence adduced, convict an accused of an offence for which he had not been charged. In our opinion, <em>Ng Ee</em> is not an authority to the effect that the High Court, in exercising the power under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) to alter the finding and in consequence to substitute a conviction for the one under appeal, is convicting the accused on a “substituted” charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Lim Teck Seng</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_17">[17]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>), the accused was charged with inconsiderate driving contrary to s&nbsp;5 of the Motor Vehicles (Driving Offences) Proclamation. At sessions court amended the charge to a more serious one of negligent driving contrary to s&nbsp;4(2) of the Proclamation. On appeal, the question before the High Court was whether the court below was justified in amending the charge in those circumstances. Rigby&nbsp;J held that it was unjust in those circumstances for a more serious charge to be substituted for the charge then preferred against the accused, and he accordingly altered the conviction from one under s&nbsp;4(2) of negligent driving to one under s&nbsp;5 of driving without reasonable consideration and convicted the accused of the latter offence. We do not find that decision of any assistance on the issue before us.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to <em>Sivalingam</em> (<a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_17">[17]</a>&nbsp;<em>supra</em>). There, the accused was charged before the Sessions Court under s&nbsp;420 of the Penal Code and was convicted. On appeal, the High Court found that an offence under s&nbsp;420 was not proved, but the court was satisfied that an offence under s&nbsp;409 was established. The High Court therefore “substituted the charge” under s&nbsp;409 for the charge on which the accused was convicted. A question of <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> was reserved for the Federal Court of Malaysia for determination as to whether the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction could substitute the charge under s&nbsp;409 for that under s&nbsp;420 without having regard to ss&nbsp;158 and 162 of the Malaysian <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code (the equivalents of ss&nbsp;163 and 167 of our CPC). The matter directly before the Federal Court was the scope of the power of the High Court under s&nbsp;316(b) [which is the equivalent of s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>) of our CPC] and in particular the power to alter the finding below. Abdul Hamid&nbsp;FJ delivering the judgment of the court said, at 173:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now the appeal before the learned judge was an appeal from a conviction, and evidently, as we can see, there is a specific provision under our <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> that empowers a judge to alter a finding. The pertinent question that calls for determination, however, is the scope of such power.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer firstly to <em>Mallal’s <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code</em> (4th&nbsp;Ed) at p&nbsp;466 where it is stated that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">The finding which an appellate court may alter under para (b) may relate to an offence with which the prisoner was charged in the court below or to one of which he might be convicted without a distinct charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason for this seems obvious. If for example, the prisoner is charged in the court below with a charge under s&nbsp;420 of the Penal Code or with s&nbsp;420 and alternatively under s&nbsp;406 of the Penal Code and is convicted under s&nbsp;420 in an appeal against the conviction, the appellate court may, provided the facts support either charge or the alternative charge, as the case may be, alter a finding and substitute a conviction for a different offence, for example, with one under s&nbsp;406 Penal Code. That power to alter is derived from s&nbsp;167 of our <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code [s&nbsp;173 of our CPC] which provides for the conviction of another offence a person is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it provided however the case is one that comes within the confines of s&nbsp;166 of our <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code [s&nbsp;172 of our CPC] and there is evidence to support the conviction for that different offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judge continued, at 174:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our <span class="blueHighlight">law</span> clearly allows the judge of a High Court in an appeal against conviction to alter a finding. Section&nbsp;316(b) provides that power. This is consistent with s&nbsp;26 of the Courts of Judicature Act … . Certain provisions of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code general in nature are also relevant for purposes of hearing such appeals. Sections&nbsp;166 and 167 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code are examples of such provisions. In hearing an appeal from a conviction the power of the judge to alter a finding must in our view be exercised subject to ss&nbsp;166 and 167 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code [ss&nbsp;172 and 173 of our CPC].</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The requirement of ss&nbsp;166 and 167 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code must be satisfied before a High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction alters or substitutes a conviction for a different offence. Although therefore an appellate court is possessed of the power which it can lawfully exercise, it is equally essential that such power be exercised within the confines of the <span class="blueHighlight">law</span>. The question is to what extent and under what circumstances such power can be invoked. What is clear in our minds is, and we emphasise, that such power must be exercised under limited circumstances and with great caution subject to the restriction imposed by s&nbsp;167 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code, and it must be done so as not to prejudice the case of an accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, we respectfully agree with what Abdul Hamid&nbsp;FJ said on the scope of the court’s power “to alter the finding” made below. However, with respect, in the ensuing paragraph he appeared to have treated a substitution of a conviction on the basis as if a substituted charge had been preferred against the accused. He said at 174:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view <em>Ng Ee</em>’s case was correctly decided and to warrant a substitution there must be clear evidence that a case for the substituted offence would have been made out or established against the accused in the court below. To put it in another way before there can be an alteration of a finding the appellate court must be satisfied that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge, the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded have been same. Further, if the substituted charge was one of the charges preferred against the accused or was an alternative charge the prosecution evidence would have been sufficient to satisfy the elements to constitute the charge and the accused’s evidence must have been substantially unchanged in that the accused’s defence would have been the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned judge was clearly not dealing with the question of amendment of a charge or for that matter the substitution of one charge for another. He said immediately after the above paragraph, the following, at 174:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We hasten to observe that we are not dealing with the question of amendment of the charge by a judge on appeal. We do not therefore see any necessity to deal with <em>Yoong Hock Pin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/MLJ/37468-M.xml&#39;)">[1977] 1&nbsp;MLJ 178</a>. In this regard we do not consider s&nbsp;158 and s&nbsp;162 of the <span class="blueHighlight">Criminal</span> Procedure Code referred to in the question reserved relevant to the determination of the question. Section&nbsp;158 deals with the power of the court to alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced and as such cannot apply to the issue at hand which essentially is related to and concerned with the question of the power of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Section&nbsp;162 is a consequential provision dealing with recall of witnesses after an alteration of a charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reported cases where our High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction altered the finding made by the court below and substituted a conviction for the one under appeal. In <em>Ng Eng Huat v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1987] SLR(R) 0636.xml&#39;)">[1987] SLR(R) 636</a> the accused was charged in the Subordinate Court with (a)&nbsp;negligence in reversing a car and colliding into the front portion of another car; and (b)&nbsp;giving a false report about the accident to the police. He was convicted on both the charges. On appeal it was argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that in relation to the first charge what he had done was not a negligent act but an intentional and deliberate act and therefore the trial court had erred in convicting him of the offence under s&nbsp;336 of the Penal Code. Chua&nbsp;J accepted the submission but he found that on the evidence the accused had committed an offence under s&nbsp;352 of the Penal Code. Having come to that finding the learned judge applying the tests laid down by Taylor&nbsp;J in <em>Lew Cheok Hin</em> substituted a conviction under that section for that under s&nbsp;336 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in <em>Cheong Seok Leng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1988] 1 SLR(R) 0530.xml&#39;)">[1988] 1 SLR(R) 530</a> the accused was convicted in the Subordinate Court of the offence of desertion under s&nbsp;15(1) of the Vigilante Corps Act (Cap&nbsp;80, 1970&nbsp;Ed). On appeal to the High Court by the accused, Chan Sek Keong&nbsp;JC (as he then was) found, <em>inter alia</em>, that on the evidence the accused had not committed the offence of desertion under s&nbsp;15(1) but had committed an offence under para&nbsp;10 of the schedule to s&nbsp;20 of the Act. He therefore substituted a conviction under para&nbsp;10 of the Schedule for the conviction under s&nbsp;15(1) of the Act. The learned judge said, at [78]–[79]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I think the defence succeeds. However, on the evidence, it is abundantly clear that he was absent without leave from his place of duty. He was under a lawful duty to report to and remain at Civil Defence School II even though he was not under a lawful duty to undergo civil defence training. It is, therefore, clear that the appellant had committed an offence under para&nbsp;10 of the Schedule to s&nbsp;24 of the Vigilante Corps Act which provides for the offence of absence without leave in the following terms:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">… Absents without leave or good cause from service or from the place where he is lawfully required for the time being to be. …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, I substitute for the conviction under appeal a conviction under [s&nbsp;20(1)] of the Vigilante Corps Act of being absent from the place where he was lawfully required for the time being to be.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, it is not correct to say that when the High Court exercises its power under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) to alter the finding and substitute a conviction for the conviction under appeal, the court is in effect convicting the accused on a “substituted” charge. The scope of such power allows the court in appropriate cases, where it finds that the accused did not commit the offence with which he was charged but had committed an offence on which no charge has been preferred against him to alter the finding below and in consequence to substitute a conviction of the latter offence for that under appeal. In effecting this substitution the court is convicting the accused of an offence with which he has not been charged. The finding which the appellate court may alter under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>)(ii) may relate either to the offence with which the accused was charged and convicted in the court below or to one which he might or could have been convicted without a distinct charge: <em>Golla Hanumappa v Emperor</em> 1912 ILR&nbsp;35 Mad 243 at 246. The power to substitute a conviction of an offence with which the accused has not been charged for the conviction of the offence on which he has been charged is limited to those circumstances set out in ss&nbsp;173, 174 and 175 of the CPC. The High Court as an appellate court can only do that which the court below can do and should have done under ss&nbsp;173, 174 and 175 of the CPC: <em>PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1993] 3 SLR(R) 0369.xml&#39;)">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 369</a> and <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1994] 3 SLR(R) 0209.xml&#39;)">[1994] 3 SLR(R) 209</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question still remains whether it is implicit in s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>) of the CPC that the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has the power to amend the charge. If a literal and strict construction is adopted, it is clear that the High Court has no such power. However, such a construction would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. Further, the High Court has the revisionary powers under ss&nbsp;266–268 of the CPC. In view of these extensive express powers, it is inconceivable that it was the intention of the Legislature that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, should not have the power to amend the charge preferred against the accused and set the record straight. A more purposive construction should in our view be adopted. We think that such power is by necessary implication implied in s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>). In the result, our answer to the first question is in the affirmative, subject to what we have to say below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power that an appellate court has in amending a charge under s&nbsp;256(<em>b</em>) of the CPC is not unlimited and obviously such power has to be exercised with great caution and not to the prejudice of the accused. The same tests laid down by Taylor&nbsp;J in <em>Lew Cheok Hin</em> and Cussen&nbsp;J in <em>Ng Ee</em> in substituting a conviction for the one under appeal are, subject to necessary modifications, appropriate and applicable to the exercise of the power of amendment of a charge. The purpose of these tests is to prevent any prejudice to the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to the instant case, we agree with the learned Chief Justice on the amendments of the charges. The amendments only took the form of an insertion of the alternative date 10&nbsp;July to the date of 6&nbsp;July with the effect that the charges alleged that the appellants committed the offences respectively either on 6 or 10&nbsp;July&nbsp;1991. The amendments satisfy fully the tests laid down by Taylor&nbsp;J and Cussen&nbsp;J and could not possibly prejudice the appellants’ defence at the trial. The learned Chief Justice considered the safeguards the court should bear in mind in exercising the power of amendment. He said, at [90]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In short, the court must be certain that the amendment should not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below. There is no practical utility in requiring the charge to be read and explained again to the accused, since there is no question of him seeking to tailor his evidence or adduce fresh evidence to meet the amended charge. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should add that even if the amendments to the charges were not made or ought not to have been made by the learned Chief Justice, the convictions of the appellants would still stand. The error made by the district judge to add the alternative charges is immaterial. It is amply clear from the terms of the original charges and the alternative charges that the appellants were charged with having committed the respective offences either on 6 or 10&nbsp;July&nbsp;1991. We do not see how it can be argued that the appellants would have been misled by such an error. Nor can it be said that the appellants would have been prejudiced by it. Section&nbsp;162 of the CPC, in our opinion, would apply in respect of such an error. That section reads:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question (2): Whether the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>’s fresh consent is required</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the district judge, fresh consents from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> were tendered before amendments were made to prefer the alternative charges against the appellants. On appeal before the learned Chief Justice it was argued that if he were minded to amend the charges, as he did, fresh consents would have to be obtained as the amendment would bring in new or different charges. With respect, such an argument had absolutely no merit and the learned Chief Justice was justified in rejecting it. The amendments made by the learned Chief Justice were to eliminate the alternative charges and to add the alternative date of 10&nbsp;July&nbsp;1991 to the date of 6&nbsp;July in the original charges. The amendments to the charges so made by the learned Chief Justice did not bring in new or different charges. The consent which has been obtained from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> fully covered the charges including those which have been amended. It was quite evident that the alternative date had been reflected in the second set of consents tendered at the close of the prosecution. In our judgment, with reference to this case specifically, no fresh consent from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> is required arising from the amendments to the charges made by the learned Chief Justice. The learned Chief Justice said, at [86]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Reverting to the present case, the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> has given his consent to prosecution in clear terms and has specified the appropriate charge in each case. The essential facts have also been set out in the consents and the charges from the outset. They have remained unchanged. Indeed, consents from the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> were in fact obtained twice, for both the original charges as well as for the amended alternative charges. The amendments which I propose to make do not bring the charges beyond the scope of the PCA, nor do they seek to introduce any material new facts. In the circumstances, I see no reason why the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span>’s consent should be obtained a third time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in entire agreement with him. Both sets of consents were clearly sufficient to indicate that the <span class="blueHighlight">Public</span> <span class="blueHighlight">Prosecutor</span> had consented to the prosecution of the appellants for the offences they each committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn to consider the second question more generally. In our opinion, much depends on the extent of the amendments of the charge. In this connection, the crucial question is whether the amendments proposed to be made would take the charge outside the scope of the consent already given. Clearly amendments such as merely in respect of the date or time would not. On the other hand, if the amendments introduce a new set of material facts or introduce a different offence such amendments would generally take the charge outside the scope of the consent, in which case a fresh consent is required. Hence, our answer to the second question is in the negative unless the amendment or proposed amendment would take the charge, as amended, outside the scope of the consent originally given.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our answers to both the questions in this case do not in any way affect the conclusion arrived at by the learned Chief Justice, namely, that the appellants stand convicted on the amended charges and the appeals before him ought to be dismissed. His decision therefore stands.</p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy">Headnoted by Arvin Lee.</p> </div></content></root></maincontent></maincontent><br> <br> </div> <p><a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%201%20SLR(R)%200095.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(Criminal%20law%20public%20prosecutor)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#anomagicid" class="goTop floatRight">Back to top</a></p> <p class="pageContentCopyright"> </p><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Singapore Academy of Law.</p> <p></p> <!-- Content Details Body Ends --> </div><!-- Result Display Ends --> <div class="annotator-outer annotator-viewer annotator-hide">
