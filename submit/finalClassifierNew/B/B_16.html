The defendant had, by a lease and purchase agreement, evidenced by an instrument in the Malay language, taken the interest in the flat – the remainder of a 199-year lease – of a cooperative society (“the Society” or “the lessor”). The defendant was the daughter of a man, since deceased, who had entered into a similar agreement with the Society, also in Malay, and who had duly paid the purchase price in full and all required property taxes. The fresh agreement with the defendant was in consideration of the defendant paying an administrative fee for the transfer of the interest to her and her mother. The Society had in turn taken a lease of 199 years over the whole property in which the flat was situated from the owner of the property. The owner had mortgaged the property to a bank (“the mortgagee”). The owner as mortgagor had agreed with the mortgagee that the statutory power of leasing conferred on a mortgagor by the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance would not be exercisable by the mortgagor without previous written consent from the mortgagee; the lease to the Society was thus entered in breach of this provision. Subsequently, the Society defaulted on its loan repayment; the bank in exercise of its rights as mortgagee sold the property to the plaintiff, who then commenced this action. The defendant took out third party proceedings against the Society claiming an indemnity and damages for breach of the agreement between them.</p> <p class="HN-Heading">Held, allowing the plaintiff’s application and the defendant’s third party claim: </p> <p class="HN-Held">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of an agreement to grant a lease in breach of a prior agreement between the lessor in its mortgage agreement with the mortgagee not to let out the subject property without consent of the mortgagee was that the lease agreement could not bind the mortgagee. The mortgagee would be entitled to obtain possession of the flat as against the mortgagor and all persons claiming under it. The mortgagee would also be entitled to exercise its power of sale as a mortgagee; such sale would overreach the equity of redemption and other rights of the mortgagor, pursuant to s&nbsp;26(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap&nbsp;61, 1994&nbsp;Rev Ed) (“CLPA”). Section&nbsp;26(1) was not restricted by s&nbsp;30(2), as s&nbsp;26(1) applied to every instance of a mortgagee sale, and the purchaser would acquire what the mortgagee was entitled to sell. Accordingly, on the sale by the mortgagee, the purchaser acquired the property free from the rights of those who obtained their rights from the mortgagor: at <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%203%20SLR(R)%200583.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_21">[21]</a>, <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%203%20SLR(R)%200583.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_22">[22]</a> and <a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%203%20SLR(R)%200583.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#p1_25">[25]</a>.</p> <p class="HN-Held">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the agreement between the lessor and the lessee was in the Malay language and not in the form of a deed, it infringed s&nbsp;53(1) of the CLPA (before the 1993 amendment) which required that a lease for a period exceeding three years shall be by deed and in the English language. The alleged lease was therefore void in law. Neither was it registered under the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap&nbsp;269, 1989&nbsp;Rev Ed) (“RDA”) or the Land Titles Act (Cap&nbsp;157, 1994&nbsp;Rev Ed) (“LTA”).

Default was clearly something foreseeable, thus the doctrine of frustration did not apply.

The action concerns a flat known as 2, Block&nbsp;B, Paya Lebar Close (hereinafter called “the flat”). The plaintiff seeks to remove a caveat lodged by the defendant against the flat.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all material times Lots&nbsp;2860 and 2990 of Mukim&nbsp;24 at Paya Lebar Close were owned by Sri Jaya (Sendirian) Berhad (“Sri Jaya”), a company incorporated in Singapore on 20&nbsp;December&nbsp;1968. On 13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1969 Sri Jaya mortgaged the two lots of land to United Malayan Banking Corporation (“UMBC”) for a loan of $1,430,000 for the specific purpose of developing the two lots. The mortgage was duly registered with the Registry of Deeds. Lot&nbsp;2860 was subsequently subdivided into Lots&nbsp;3392, 3393 and 3394 and Lot&nbsp;2990 was subdivided into Lots&nbsp;4905 and 4906. Lots&nbsp;3392, 3393, 3394 and 4905 were surrendered to the State leaving only Lot&nbsp;4906 for development.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cl&nbsp;5(q) of the indenture of mortgage it was specifically provided that the statutory power of leasing conferred on a mortgagor by the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance would not be exercisable by the mortgagor without the previous consent in writing of UMBC. UMBC had never so consented to Sri Jaya granting any lease to any third party.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blocks of flats were erected by Sri Jaya on Lot&nbsp;4906, which are known as Block&nbsp;A and Block&nbsp;B. The blocks were completed in 1974. Block&nbsp;B consists of 15&nbsp;flats and one of them is the subject of this action. There is no evidence before me to show that the strata titles to the flats have been issued.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that sometime in the early seventies, Sri Jaya agreed to lease the entire Block&nbsp;B to the Singapore National Housing Co-operative Society Ltd (“the Society”), a society registered under the Singapore Co-operative Societies Ordinance, now known as the Co-operative Societies Act, for a term of 199&nbsp;years from 2&nbsp;January&nbsp;1975 at a consideration of $420,000, or $28,000 for each flat. No copy of the lease agreement is available. Though the lease agreement was lodged for registration with the Registry of Deeds, but for reasons which are not known, that registration was withdrawn on 3&nbsp;December&nbsp;1977. Only a copy of the draft lease agreement (unsigned) has been found: it bears no date but only the year 1975.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime on 1&nbsp;December&nbsp;1974 the defendant’s father, one Wahab bin Sheikh Daud (“Wahab”), entered into an agreement in Malay with the Society to lease and purchase the flat (“the first agreement”). In essence it provided that on expiry of six years and upon complying with the terms therein, the Society would transfer the flat to Wahab. Presumably the transfer would be in relation to the 199-year lease which the Society was to obtain from Sri Jaya. Wahab paid to the Society the sum of $28,000. No steps were taken to have the agreement registered with the Registry of Deeds or the Registry of Titles. Neither was any transfer of the 199-year lease effected in favour of Wahab.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1983 Sri Jaya defaulted in their repayment under the mortgage. On 29&nbsp;November&nbsp;1983, UMBC commenced Suit No&nbsp;5904/83 against Sri Jaya and others and claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, for a declaration that they were entitled to sell the property. On 2&nbsp;October&nbsp;1991 a consent judgment was entered against Sri Jaya giving a right to UMBC to sell Lot&nbsp;4906, with the two blocks of flats, free from any interest claimed by Sri Jaya. Sri Jaya was also required to deliver up possession of the property to UMBC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Wahab died on 5&nbsp;October&nbsp;1984. It appears that no one took out letters of administration to his estate. However, the defendant and her mother, Chei bte Embi (“Chei”), continued to reside in the flat. On 9&nbsp;November&nbsp;1984, in response to an enquiry made by the defendant, the Society replied offering to transfer the ownership of the flat (presumably the 199-year lease) to the defendant and her mother, Chei, jointly on condition that she would pay an administrative fee of $1,400, being 5% of the purchase price paid by her father, Wahab. This administrative fee was duly paid by the defendant and the Society entered into a fresh lease and purchase agreement with Chei and the defendant (“the second agreement”) and the agreement was backdated to 1&nbsp;December&nbsp;1974. The second agreement was in identical terms with those of the first agreement and it was also in the Malay language. Like the first agreement, the second agreement was also not registered. The Society has not made any effort to transfer the 199-year lease of the flat to the defendant and her mother as the Society itself has not yet obtained any such title.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18&nbsp;May&nbsp;1993, UMBC demanded that the defendant deliver up possession of the flat. She refused. On 11&nbsp;June&nbsp;1993 UMBC instituted Suit No&nbsp;1285/1993 against the defendant claiming for possession of the flat. Defence was filed. However, that action has become dormant for the reason that UMBC had sold Lot&nbsp;4906 (with Blocks&nbsp;A and B) to the plaintiff herein.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 22nd&nbsp;annual general meeting of the Society held on 29&nbsp;August&nbsp;1993, the question involving Block&nbsp;B was discussed. The minutes of the meeting recorded the following:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Chairman also touched on the auditor’s report concerning Block&nbsp;B, Paya Lebar Close. He reported that, at that moment, (the Society), the Bank and residents of Block&nbsp;B were in the midst of discussion and he hoped that all the parties who were involved could adopt a give and take attitude for their benefit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23&nbsp;August&nbsp;1994 the defendant lodged a caveat against the flat and claimed interest therein as a purchaser pursuant to:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an agreement for lease dated 22nd&nbsp;day of March&nbsp;1976 between (Sri Jaya) of the one part and (the Society) of the other part for the lease of the land above described.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an agreement for sale and purchase dated 1st&nbsp;day of December&nbsp;1974 made between (the society) and (the defendant) of the other part for the lease of the land above described.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about the same time, UMBC in exercise of its rights as a mortgagee sold Lot&nbsp;4906 together with Blocks&nbsp;A and B (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the whole property”) to Win Supreme Investment (S) Pte Ltd, the plaintiff in this action. The whole property was conveyed to Win Supreme on 30&nbsp;September&nbsp;1994 “freed and discharged from all rights or equity of redemption and from all claims and demands whatsoever under the said mortgage”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence to show that the defendant’s father paid property tax in respect of the flat from 1975 till his death, and after that, the defendant has been paying that tax to date. Though the defendant’s family have been occupying the flat since 1975, they have not paid rent to any person. It seems to me clear that first Wahab, and then the defendant, have been occupying the flat pursuant to the two agreements with the Society and in turn, the Society obtained possession of Block&nbsp;B by virtue of the agreement with Sri Jaya.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence is quite clear that before UMBC sold the whole property to Win Supreme, UMBC was aware that the defendant was occupying the subject flat; so did Win Supreme. Tan Kian Kee, the general manager of the plaintiff, told this court that before Win Supreme agreed to purchase the property, he had inspected both blocks and found occupants in both. Tan also said that the purchase was without vacant possession.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the relevant time the shareholders of Sri Jaya were Syed Esa Almenoar, Salleh bin Mat and Abd Kadir bin Hj Manjoorshah. In 1993, Syed Esa Almenoar and Hj Salleh Mat were the chairman and treasurer respectively of the Society. There is no evidence whether in the mid-seventies both these two persons held the same positions in the Society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case for the plaintiff is that as the defendant has occupied the flat without the written consent or licence of UMBC, therefore, the plaintiff as a purchaser from UMBC, takes the whole property, including the flat, freed from any estate, interest or rights of the defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the defendant says that the lease of Block&nbsp;B by Sri Jaya to the Society was with the consent or knowledge of UMBC; that the purchase money paid by the defendant’s father Wahab to the Society would have been remitted by the Society to Sri Jaya, which in turn would have paid it over to UMBC; that UMBC knew or ought to have known of the defendant’s father’s occupation of the flat since 1975. In the alternative, the defendant says that by their conduct UMBC had acquiesced in the said occupation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the defendant also took out third party proceedings against the Society claiming an indemnity from the Society in the event that her defence to the action of the plaintiff should fail and also for damages for breach of the second agreement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its defence to the third party proceedings, the Society avers that by an agreement it entered into with Sri Jaya, Sri Jaya would upon the completion of the construction of Block&nbsp;B issue a lease in respect of Block&nbsp;B to the Society. The Society says that the performance of the second agreement (between the Society and the defendant) was frustrated because of the action of UMBC as mortgagee in selling the whole property to the plaintiff herein.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central issue which I have to determine is, on the facts as enumerated above, what rights or interest has the defendant acquired in the flat? To answer that, a number of other related questions have to be addressed. First, had Sri Jaya the right to grant a 199-year lease to the Society? Following the mortgage, Sri Jaya has only an equity of redemption in Lot&nbsp;4906, which is an equitable interest in land. Under the terms of the mortgage (cl&nbsp;5(q)) Sri Jaya could not exercise the statutory power of leasing without the written consent of UMBC. There was no evidence of any such written consent having been given.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the effect of such an agreement to grant a lease in breach of cl&nbsp;5(q)? As between Sri Jaya and the Society, clearly it may be enforced as a contract. But it cannot bind the mortgagee. UMBC would be entitled to obtain possession of the flat as against Sri Jaya and all persons claiming under Sri Jaya: <em>Standard Chartered Bank v Paisley Park (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 1 SLR (R) 26. UMBC would also be entitled to exercise its power of sale as a mortgagee: <em>Duke v Robson</em> [1973] 1&nbsp;All ER 481. A sale by a mortgagee would overreach the rights of the mortgagor: see s&nbsp;26(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap&nbsp;61, 1994&nbsp;Ed) (“CLPA”). As Plowman&nbsp;J said in <em>Duke v Robson</em> when construing s&nbsp;104 of the English Law of Property Act 1925, which is <em>in pari materia</em> with our s&nbsp;26(1) (at 485):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The effect of these provisions … is that a sale by a mortgagee under a charge by way of a legal mortgage overreaches the equity of redemption and all rights subsisting in that equity, including the right of a purchaser from the mortgagor and notwithstanding that he may have registered an estate contract in respect of his contract of sale.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the defendant argued that s&nbsp;26(1) cannot apply to the instant case because the sale here was pursuant to an order of court obtained under s&nbsp;30(2). He said that the terms of the order of court and s&nbsp;6(2) of the CLPA would govern the sale. I do not think there is anything in s&nbsp;30(2) which restricts the operation of s&nbsp;26(1), as the latter applies to every instance of a mortgagee sale. As for s&nbsp;6(2), which provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that a conveyance of land having houses or other buildings thereon shall be deemed to include all outhouses, sewers, gutters, drains, lights, watercourses, easement <em>etc</em> appertaining to the land, houses or other buildings conveyed, it is a wholly irrelevant provision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard another pertinent case relied upon by the plaintiff is <em>City Permanent Building Society v Miller</em> [1952] 2&nbsp;All ER&nbsp;621. There the brief facts are these. On 15&nbsp;October, 1950, the first defendant, Miller, orally agreed to grant to the second defendant, Mrs&nbsp;Cumberland, a lease or tenancy of a flat, although he then had no interest in the premises. The next day, 16&nbsp;October, having received £228 from her, Miller executed a document acknowledging receipt of the payment being three years’ rent at 30s per week in advance in respect of the flat. He also stated that he agreed to grant to Mrs&nbsp;Cumberland tenancy of the flat for three years from 16&nbsp;October, 1950, and “thereafter on a weekly basis, at a rental of 30s per week”. Some two months later, on 4&nbsp;January&nbsp;1951, the registered proprietor of the property executed a transfer of it in favour of the first defendant, and, on the same day, the first defendant granted a legal charge on the property to the plaintiff, the City Permanent Building Society, to secure an advance of some £600. Some six days later the first defendant gave the key of the premises to the second defendant. On 11&nbsp;January&nbsp;1951 he was registered at the Land Registry as proprietor of the property, and the building society was registered as chargee in respect of its legal charge. On 15&nbsp;January&nbsp;1951 the second defendant went into possession of the flat, and, in reliance on the document of 16&nbsp;October&nbsp;1950, paid no more rent. After she had been in possession for more than ten months, she learnt that the building society had a claim against the property. The building society denied her right to remain in possession on the terms which she had made with the first defendant. On a summons by the building society claiming possession of the premises, the first defendant did not appear. It was contended on behalf of the second defendant that the agreement between the defendants, which was evidenced by the document of 16&nbsp;October, 1950, created an overriding interest, within the meaning of the Land Registration Act 1925 s&nbsp;70(1)(k), being a lease for a “term … not exceeding twenty-one years, granted at a rent without taking a fine”. Harman&nbsp;J, held that the second defendant did not acquire an overriding interest in the premises, as the £228, the receipt of which was acknowledged in the document of October&nbsp;16, 1950, was a fine, and, accordingly, he gave judgment for the building society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On appeal, the Court of Appeal held, taking from the headnote:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the agreement evidenced by the document of October&nbsp;16, 1950, related to a term which, under the combined effect of s&nbsp;52(1) and (2)(d), s&nbsp;53(1)(a), and s&nbsp;54(2) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, could be created only by a deed, as it was for a term necessarily exceeding three years by a period of at least a week, and, therefore, the agreement did not create a legal term in the premises, and Mrs&nbsp;C’s interest thereunder was, at highest, that of a person who had a contract for the grant of a lease and a right to obtain the specific performance of that contract.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;notwithstanding that, by a s&nbsp;3(x) of the Land Registration Act 1925, the definition of ‘lease’ covered an ‘agreement for a lease’ unless the context otherwise required, the words: ‘Leases for any term or interest not exceeding twenty-one years, granted at a rent without taking a fine’, in s&nbsp;70(l)(k) of the Act, did not include a mere agreement for a lease, as the word ‘granted’ clearly imported the actual creation of a term, and this excluded, by force of the context, the case of an agreement for a lease having no more than contractual effect, and, therefore, the right which Mrs&nbsp;C, had acquired under the document of October&nbsp;16, 1950, was not a ‘lease’ within s&nbsp;70(1)(k) so as to be an ‘overriding interest’ within the sub-section, and she had not acquired an interest which took priority to the legal charge taken by the building society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the above are cases where it was the mortgagee who instituted the action to recover possession. Does it make any difference if the mortgaged property is sold by the mortgagee and it is the purchaser who seeks possession? Counsel was not able to provide me with any authority on point. But having regard to s&nbsp;26(1) of the CLPA, I do not think it should make any difference. The purchaser would have acquired what the mortgagee was entitled to sell. Accordingly, on the sale by UMBC, the plaintiffs have acquired the property free from the rights of those who obtained their rights from Sri Jaya and subsequent to the mortgage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty in the way of the defendant’s claim is that the person who paid to the Society for a transfer of the 199-year lease of the flat was the defendant’s father, Wahab, not the defendant. Therefore, if at all any person has any equitable interest over the flat it is Wahab. As Wahab had passed away in 1984, his estate would have succeeded to his rights, not the defendant as such. Here, as evidenced by the caveat lodged, the defendant is seeking to claim rights and interest in the flat in her own right and not as an administrator (the father having made no will) of Wahab’s estate or as a beneficiary to protect or recover the assets of the estate: <em>Wong Moy v Soo Ah Choy</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1996] 3 SLR(R) 0027.xml&#39;)">[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some other difficulties in the way of the claim of the defendant are the following. As mentioned above, the second agreement, which was between the Society and the defendant and Chei (as indeed the first agreement), was in the Malay language and not in the form of a deed. It therefore infringed s&nbsp;53(1) of the CLPA (before the 1993 amendment) which required that a lease for a period exceeding three years shall be by deed and in the English language. The alleged lease is therefore void in law although it could operate as an agreement to lease, namely, <em>in personam</em>. Neither was the second agreement registered under the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap&nbsp;269, 1989&nbsp;Ed) (“RDA”) or the Land Titles Act (Cap&nbsp;157, 1994&nbsp;Ed) (“LTA”). Under s&nbsp;4 of the RDA, a lease or an agreement for a lease unless registered “shall not be admissible in any court as evidence of title”. Under s&nbsp;45(1) of the LTA, no instrument (which includes a lease) is effectual to pass any estate or interest in land under the Act unless registered.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant sought to rely on the case <em>Khew Ah Bah v Hong Ah Mye</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1971-1973] SLR(R) 0107.xml&#39;)">[1971–1973] SLR(R) 107</a> in support of what she claimed. The Society also submitted that the case supported the defendant’s claim. There the High Court (Choor Singh&nbsp;J) held that where a landlord has let vacant land with permission to a tenant to build thereon and the tenant has expended money in putting up a building on the land it is not sufficient for the landlord to give a valid notice to quit in order to recover possession of his land. Such a tenant has a tenancy coupled with an equity. Not only must the tenancy be validly determined but the equity must also be satisfied by the landlord before he can recover possession. In that case, the ownership of the land changed hands several times. But that could not affect the rights of the tenant as the subsequent owners bought with notice of the tenant’s rights. However, I could not see how that case which involved different fact situation, could assist the defendant. Furthermore, here, the rights of the mortgagee precede those of Wahab and the defendant, if any.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the above reasons, I hold that the defendant has not acquired any rights to the flat which would overreach the rights of the mortgagee, UMBC. On the sale by UMBC, the purchaser (“the plaintiff”) has acquired the whole property freed from the rights subsisting in the equity of redemption. Accordingly, I would order that the caveat lodged by the defendant be removed and that she gives up possession of the flat within three months hereof. I would also grant a declaration that the plaintiff holds the whole property freed from the rights and interest of the defendant. The plaintiff shall have the costs of the action.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant also alluded to the fact that the plaintiff made offers of compensation to the other occupiers in the block in order to have them vacate their flats. As far as I can see, these offers were made with a view to a settlement on a without prejudice basis. Furthermore, it was not as if the defendant was not accorded a similar offer. For her own reasons she rejected it. Thus, I fail to understand how the defendant could be heard to complain on that score.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move to consider the third party claim there is a point of pleading which I ought to refer to. At the commencement of the trial, the defendant sought to amend her pleadings to insert a claim based on adverse possession. This was objected to by the plaintiff. I disallowed the amendment because it was entirely inconsistent with her case and what was deposed to in her affidavit evidence-in-chief. Her case was that she was allowed into occupation of the flat by an agreement with the Society which in turn was also given possession by Sri Jaya. I could not see how she could claim adverse possession against UMBC which only obtained possession of the whole property in 1991.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third party claim the only defence raised by the Society is that of frustration. The Society says that the agreement between the Society and the defendant (“the second agreement”) was frustrated when UMBC exercised the power of sale. Furthermore, as the defendant has benefitted by occupying the premises for more than twenty years no refund of any money should be made by the Society to the defendant. No issue was taken that the $28,000 was not paid by the defendant and her mother. I should add that following leave granted to the defendant to make a further written submission on a point (after judgment was reserved) leave was also given to the plaintiff and the third party to respond. In its further submission, and for the first time, the third party made the point that it had entered into the second agreement with the defendant and her mother by mistake and thus it is void in law. This is not a point pleaded in its defence to the third party claim. On the facts, estoppel might well apply. In any event, I do not think this is a point I ought to consider.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the events that had occurred it is clear that the Society will not be able to effect the transfer of the 199-year lease to the defendant, an impossibility brought about by the act of UMBC. It is settled law that the doctrine of frustration applies to a contract for the sale or demise of immovable property: <em>Lim Kim Som v Sheriffa Taibah bte Abdul Rahman</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0233.xml&#39;)">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 233</a> and <em>Capital Quality Homes Ltd v Colwyn Construction Ltd</em> (1975) 61&nbsp;DLR (3d) 385. But in both those two cases, there were some form of statutory interventions. In <em>Lim Kim Som</em> compulsory acquisition intervened and in <em>Capital Quality Homes</em> there was a legislative amendment. In <em>Capital Quality Homes</em> the Ontario Court of Appeal stated that the doctrine of frustration comes into play when a supervening event, beyond the control of the parties and not contemplated by them, results in a significant change in the original obligations. I do not think the events of the present case fall within those terms. UMBC exercised the power of sale because of Sri Jaya’s default. The Society must have been aware of the mortgage by Sri Jaya to UMBC and must also have realised that if Sri Jaya were to be in default, UMBC could exercise the power of sale. Default by Sri Jaya to UMBC was clearly something foreseeable. Thus I do not think the doctrine of frustration applies. In my opinion the Society is in breach, in so far as the defendant is concerned, when it is unable to convey the 199-year lease to the defendant. Admittedly in all probability the Society could in turn seek an indemnity or claim damages from Sri Jaya for the latter’s breach. But that is no excuse for the Society. A seller is in breach notwithstanding that he is let down by his own supplier.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I find that the Society is in breach of contract to the defendant in not being able to convey a 199-year lease to the defendant. However, in the circumstances, there is no question of specific performance. The Society is thus liable to the defendant in damages. The question of the Society obtaining an indemnity/damages from Sri Jaya does not arise as the Society has not brought in Sri Jaya as a party. It is not in dispute that the flat is now worth $410,000. That would be the measure of damages which the Society should pay to the defendant and I would so order. The defendant shall have the costs of the third party proceedings.</p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy">Headnoted by Arvin Lee.</p> </div></content></root></maincontent></maincontent><br> <br> </div> <p><a href="https://www-lawnet-sg.lawproxy1.nus.edu.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=pop_up&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=viewDocumentInReadingPane&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_viewDocumentInReadingPane=true&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_documentID=/SLR/[1996]%203%20SLR(R)%200583.xml&amp;_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_queryStr=(CONTRACT%20LAW%20breach%20of%20contract%20frustration)&amp;highlightActive=true&amp;showAnnotation=Y#anomagicid" class="goTop floatRight">Back to top</a></p> <p class="pageContentCopyright"> </p><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Singapore Academy of Law.</p> <p></p> <!-- Content Details Body Ends --> </div><!-- Result Display Ends --> <div class="annotator-outer annotator-viewer annotator-hide">
