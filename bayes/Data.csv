1,Staywell v Starwood,2013,Sgca,OS,3,,,6_3_9_5_6_7,"38 Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that the marks have a substantial degree of aural similarity and a fair degree of conceptual similarity. The PAR’s finding that the marks were visually dissimilar was not appealed. On the whole, and based on what we have set out above, we have no difficulty finding that the marks were similar. On this basis, we dismiss CA 147/2013.","38 Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that the marks have a substantial degree of aural similarity and a fair degree of conceptual similarity. The PAR’s finding that the marks were visually dissimilar was not appealed. On the whole, and based on what we have set out above, we have no difficulty finding that the marks were similar. On this basis, we dismiss CA 147/2013.",33 We therefore see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that the marks had aural similarity. In fact we find that there is a high degree of aural similarity between the competing marks because of the distinctiveness of the common “Regis” component in both the technical and non-technical senses.,"37 However, we find that there is some conceptual similarity between the marks but for a different reason. There is some strength in the Opponents’ argument that both the Applicant and Opponent Marks evoke the idea of a place or location. Although the ST. REGIS mark might conjure the image of a saintly person, in Singapore by far the most common manifestation of saintly names is in relation to places ranging from schools (St Joseph’s Institution, St Margaret’s School), roads (St George’s Road, St Martins Lane), hospitals (St Luke’s Hospital) and condominiums (St Nicholas View, St Patrick’s Court), to an assortment of other public places (St Michael’s flatted factory, St James Power Station (bar), Le Saint Julien (restaurant)), many of which have no particular association whatsoever with the saintly character whose name they have adopted. Similarly, the word “Park”, as noted by the Judge, connotes the idea of a geographical location though not necessarily of any particular type (see [26] of the GD). Therefore, in the Singapore context, the marks share a tendency to connote a place or location or building which, as between the competing marks in question, are linked by the common reference to “Regis”.","43 In relation to its Class 35 registration, the Judge accepted the PAR’s finding that Staywell’s advertising, marketing and business management services were adjunct to and inseparable from its primary services under Class 43, and therefore similar to the Opponent’s Class 43 services (GD ([8] supra) at [32]–[33]). We agree with the Judge’s reasoning to the extent that Staywell’s Class 35 services are closely related and indeed inseparable from its Class 43 hotel and restaurant services. This is not to say that Staywell’s application for registration under the two classes was to be considered and compared collectively as against the Opponents’ Class 43 services. Rather, the real question is whether Staywell’s services that were sought to be registered under Class 35 are similar to the Opponents’ services under Class 43, having regard to all relevant factors relating to the services themselves. Some of the factors set out in British Sugar plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd [1996] RPC 281 (“British Sugar”) at 296 would be relevant at the goods-similarity stage of the inquiry, in particular the consideration of the uses and the end-users of the services. The question is how the services are regarded, as a practical matter, for the purposes of trade. Applying this approach, we agree with the PAR’s findings at [63] of the PAR’s GD. There is an overlap between the uses and users of Staywell’s Class 35 business management and administration services, and its Class 43 service of providing hotel venues for business conferences and receptions. As for the advertising and marketing services under Class 35, these relate to the promotion of the hotel and restaurant services under Class 43. Therefore we agree that there is similarity between Staywell’s services in Class 35 and the Opponents’ services in Class 43.","117 Notwithstanding our rejection of the doctrine of initial interest confusion, we reverse the Judge’s dismissal of the opposition under s 8(2)(b) of the Act. We affirm her finding that the marks were, on the whole, similar, and that the services were in essence identical; but we disagree that this similarity did not give rise to a likelihood of confusion at the point of sale of the parties’ respective services. On the contrary, we are satisfied in the circumstances that there was a sufficient likelihood of confusion by reason of the similarity in the competing marks and the services. In our judgment, because of this similarity, the average customer would have likely been confused as to whether the owners of the competing marks were economically linked and it was therefore an impermissible infraction of the Opponents’ rights to permit the registration to proceed."
6*S,Ceramiche v Caesarstone,2017,Sgca,OS,3,5,"30 The Appellant does not challenge the Judge’s findings on distinctiveness, but submits that the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark “enjoys a higher threshold before the [Respondent’s] CAESARSTONE Mark will be considered dissimilar to it”. In our judgment, this is incorrect. What we held in Staywell (at [25]) was that a mark which has greater technical distinctiveness enjoys a high threshold before a competing sign will be considered dissimilar to it. The PAR concluded on this basis that “a mark which has a normal level of technical distinctiveness will correspondingly enjoy only a normal threshold before a competing sign will be considered dissimilar to it” [emphasis in original]. Thus, when the PAR (and the Judge) held that the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark had a medium level of distinctiveness, what she (and the Judge) probably meant was that the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark was of a normal level of distinctiveness and therefore enjoyed only a normal threshold before the Respondent’s CAESARTSTONE Mark would be considered dissimilar to it.",6_7_8_7_7_7,"55 To summarise our findings on the similarity of marks, there is, in our judgment, as between the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark and the Respondent’s CAESARSTONE Mark, a moderate level of visual similarity (see [44] above) and a high level of aural similarity (see [47] above). As far as conceptual similarity is concerned, this is either neutral or there would be a high level of conceptual similarity; but as we see it, there is no basis for finding any conceptual dissimilarity (see [52]–[53] above). On the whole, we find that the marks are similar rather than dissimilar.","44 We appreciate that there are several other stylistic differences between the two marks. These include differences in (a) the font; (b) the letter case; (c) the overall length of the textual components; and (d) the arrangement of the letters, in particular, the ligating of the “a” and the “e” in the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark. However, as we have observed earlier (see [27] above), the fact that the average consumer is treated as having “imperfect recollection” means that the two contesting marks are not to be compared or assessed side by side and examined in detail for the sake of isolating particular points of difference (Hai Tong ([27] supra) at [40(d)]). Hence, while these differences may be evident (and even obvious) on a side-by-side comparison, this is not how visual similarity is to be assessed. In our judgment, these stylistic differences do not substantially detract from the fact that the overall impression conveyed by both marks is dominated by the word “caesar”. In all the circumstances and having regard also to these stylistic differences, we consider that the marks are of a moderate level of visual similarity.","47 Under the first approach, we consider that, for the purposes of the aural analysis, the dominant component of the Respondent’s CAESARSTONE Mark is again the word “caesar”. The device is obviously irrelevant in the aural analysis, while what we have said in relation to the word “stone” in the context of the visual analysis (see [41]–[42] above) applies with equal force in this context. The dominant component of the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark, which, without doubt, is the word “caesar”, is identical. As for the second approach, the two marks clearly have more syllables in common than not. In these premises, it is our view that the two marks have a high level of aural similarity.","55 To summarise our findings on the similarity of marks, there is, in our judgment, as between the Appellant’s CAESAR Mark and the Respondent’s CAESARSTONE Mark, a moderate level of visual similarity (see [44] above) and a high level of aural similarity (see [47] above). As far as conceptual similarity is concerned, this is either neutral or there would be a high level of conceptual similarity; but as we see it, there is no basis for finding any conceptual dissimilarity (see [52]–[53] above). On the whole, we find that the marks are similar rather than dissimilar.","91 As mentioned earlier (see [26] above), it is not disputed that the element of similarity of goods is satisfied in the present case.","92     To summarise our findings on the likelihood of confusion, we consider that (a) the nature of the goods, on the whole, points towards a likelihood of confusion (see [79] and [82] above); (b) the mode of purchase is, at best, a neutral factor (see [87] above); and (c) the similarity of marks points towards a likelihood of confusion (see [89] above), as does the similarity of goods (see [91] above). On the whole, we think that there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public."

The ground of invalidation under Section 8(2)(a) therefore succeeds.","27 Applying the test to the present facts, the analysis is a fairly straightforward one. The Subject Markappears to be identical to one of the Applicants’ earlier series mark. Both comprise the combination of letters “U-LI” using the same, or almost the same, font type and arranged in the same order. Although the Subject Mark is a single mark while the Applicants’ mark is protected as a unitary series of two marks, there is no significant differentiation as visually, the Subject Mark appears to be virtually identical to the black and white portion of the earlier series marks. The additional colour in one of the earlier series mark, being a non-distinctive feature of the mark, also does not substantially affect the identity of the marks.","28 In the submissions, counsel for Respondent somewhat flipped-flopped on this issue, sometimes arguing that the two marks are similar but not identical, while at other occasions, accusing the Applicants of effectively using an “identical” U-LI mark as the Respondent’s to market U-LI products.

Indeed, the likelihood of confusion is already clearly demonstrated in the evidence tendered by the Applicants where customers had wrongly indicated in their purchase orders the name “United U-LI Marketing Pte Ltd”, when it should have been “United U-LI Projects Pte Ltd” (see NCH-1, paragraph 40, pages 284-285)."
8,Monster v Glamco,2018,Sghc,OF,3,5,"52 Having determined that the Appellant’s Earlier Monster Marks do not possess a high level of technical distinctiveness, there is accordingly no need for a higher threshold to be crossed before the Application Markwill be considered dissimilar to it. I now turn to consider the similarity of the marks.",3_3_6_3_3_X,"66 To summarise my findings, the Application Mark and the Appellant’s Earlier Monster Marks are visually and conceptually dissimilar but are aurally more similar than dissimilar. On the whole, I find that the marksare on balance more dissimilar than similar.","60 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Application Mark is visually dissimilar to the Appellant’s Earlier Monster Marks.","62 I agree with the PAR’s analysis that when applying the quantitative assessment approach, the markshave more syllables in common than not since two out of the three syllables in the Application Mark are identical to that of the Appellant’s Earlier Monster Marks (GD at [80]). I would add that the sequence of the syllables is also relevant in determining whether the marks are aurally similar. Consider the hypothetical situation where a mark that is pronounced “ster-sweet-mon” is compared to a mark that is pronounced “mon-ster”. In such a case, even though two out of three syllables may also be similar, one would be less inclined to find that the marks are aurally similar. However, in the present case, such an issue does not arise given that the syllables which are similar (ie, “mon” and “ster”) also appear in the same sequence. Therefore, I find that the marks are aurally more similar than dissimilar.","64 I am of the view that the Application Mark and the Appellant’s Earlier Monster Marks are conceptually dissimilar, because the idea and impression that each mark conveys is very different. I agree with both the PAR and the Respondent that the analysis adopted by the Registrar in Itochu ([37] supra) is applicable to the present case. Itochu involved a comparison of the word marks “CAMEL” and “SWEETCAMEL”. The Registrar found that the “CAMEL” mark evokes a sense of ruggedness, adventure and masculinity. This is unsurprising given that a camel is usually seen as a beast of burden that has to traverse long distances across parched desert conditions. However, the Registrar found that because of the addition of the adjective “sweet”, the “SWEETCAMEL” mark projects the totally opposite impression (at [37]).","75 Therefore, although this would strictly have no bearing on my decision, I am of the view that the Appellant’s and the Respondent’s respective registered goods are dissimilar. Accordingly, the Appellant’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA cannot succeed.","77 Given my finding at [66] above that the competing marks are dissimilar, there is strictly no need for me to consider whether there is a likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, there is no need for me to consider whether the Appellant has a family of marks. Be that as it may, I will, for completeness, make some brief observations on this issue."

Moreover, as the Opponent rightly pointed out, the overall impression of visual identity between the two marks is reinforced by two factors. First, both marks contain a protruding/prominent letter “Y”. And second, both marks appear in upper-case block letters. For these reasons, I consider the marks to be visually identical.

The Applicant also conceded that the marks are conceptually identical.,"38 I do not propose to deal with all of the submissions advanced on both sides. It is preferable to focus instead on the category of services in italics in the table at [35] above. [note: 13] There can be no doubt, to my mind, that the italicised services are similar to at least some of the goods covered under the Prior Mark. Take for example the good “Clothing” and the service “retail services with regard to clothing”. Or “boots; shoes; sandals” on the one hand and “retail services with regard to” “footwear” on the other. The common thread between these two instances is that one is the good itself whereas the other is the service of providing the specific good. This is the very situation envisaged by the authorities where goods and services can be considered to be similar for the purposes of the provision: see [32] – [33] above). (These examples are by no means exhaustive, and many other points of similarity between the italicised services and the relevant goods can be identified though this same lens.)","51 In my judgment, the Opponent is obviously right that if the Application Mark were allowed to proceed to registration, a substantial portion of the relevant public would likely be confused on account of the fact that the marks are identical and the similarity between the respective goods and services. I fail to see how it could be otherwise. There might be no evidence of actual confusion, but that is only to be expected since the Applicant has no “NEWYORKER” stores in this country."
10,Singtel v Megaport,2018,Sgipos,OF,1,5,"23 Further, I am also of the view that the Opponent’s Earlier Meg@POP Mark sits in the middle of the technical distinctiveness spectrum.",3_3_6_3_10_0,"74 I have concluded that the Opponent’s Earlier Meg@POP Mark in comparison to the Application Markis visually and conceptually more dissimilar than similar while there is some aural similarity. Overall, I am of the view that the marks are more dissimilar than similar.","40 In light of all of the above, the Opponent’s Earlier Meg@POP Mark is clearly visually different from the Application Mark. The immediate and direct visual impact foisted by the Opponent’s Earlier Meg@POP Mark on the eye is in contrast to the Application Mark, which is a plain word mark sans any form of ornamentation.

41 Having regard to the above, I am of the view that the marks are visually more dissimilar than similar.
","56 In light of the above, the marks are aurally more similar than dissimilar.","72 Having regard to all the different connotations which may be conjured up by the marks, I am of the view that the marks are conceptually more dissimilar than similar. It is to be recalled that, the conclusion which is required to be drawn at the end of the day is whether the marks are more dissimilar than similar.[note: 32]","77 The Court of Appeal in Staywell provided at [40] “that registration in the same specification within a class establishes a prima facie case for identity”. The identical service is highlighted above (italicised and in bold), namely, “telecommunication services”. As this element has been satisfied, there is no need to consider T0312221G (registered for Class 42).","99 Therefore, while I agree with the Opponent that it is not sufficient to simply argue on the basis that the Opponent’s clients (as reflected by the Opponent’s evidence) were / are corporations seeking to purchase expensive and technical products thus diminishing the likelihood of confusion, having regard to the nature of “telecommunication services”, there is nonetheless no likelihood of confusion even though the potential consumer includes the “man on the street”."
11,Monster v NBA,2018,Sgipos,OF,3,6,"31 On the other hand, I am aware that the Claw Device Mark’s resemblance to the slashing or ripping effect of an animal’s claw may have some connotative link to the qualities that other traders in the energy drink business, or any other business, may wish to evoke as part of their brand image – strength, vigour and forcefulness. Nevertheless, on balance, I take the view that the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark has an above-average degree of inherent distinctiveness. I am prepared to accept the above-average degree of inherent distinctiveness of the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark means that this mark enjoys a wider-than-usual scope of protection, in that more non-identical competing marks can be regarded as “similar” to this mark compared to other registered trade marks that only possess an ordinary level of inherent distinctiveness. However, I would not go so far as to say that the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark possesses such a great level of technical distinctiveness that there is a “high threshold” – in terms of the differences between it and other later competing marks – before the Application Mark will be considered dissimilar to it.",3_3_0_3_X_X,"61 While accepting the Opponent’s submission that its Claw Device Mark is the distinctive and dominant component of its Composite Mark, but rejecting its submission that the graphic device element in the Application Mark should be regarded as the dominant component of the Applicant’s Mark, I have compared the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark against the whole Application Mark to determine if they are similar for the purposes of Section 8(2)(b) of the Act. Since I have found that the marks are visually and conceptually dissimilar, and there is no evidence to indicate that these marks are aurally similar, it follows that the Application Mark is not similar to the Opponent’s earlier registered trade marks.","55 While the average consumer with imperfect recollection may not scrutinise all the individual details of the Application Mark, there are enough obvious visual differences between it and the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark to distinguish them from each other. In my judgment, the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Marksare visually dissimilar.","56 Whether there is any aural similarity between the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Marks requires a comparison to be made between the syntax and syllables of the textual elements of each mark. As the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark has no textual elements, there are no aural elements to be compared against the words found in the Application Mark, a composite mark which incorporates “TORONTO RAPTORS”. As far as the Opponent’s Composite Mark is concerned, the absence of any commonality between its word component (“MONSTER ENERGY”), and the word component of the Application Mark (“TORONTO RAPTORS”)means that there is no aural similarity between these marks. In its written submissions, the Opponent did not submit that the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Earlier Marks are aurally similar (OWS at [30]). It follows that the Opponent has not established any aural similarity between the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Marks.","60 Viewed holistically, the Opponent’s Claw Device Mark and Composite Mark convey the general idea of an unidentified feral creature whose three-pronged claw has produced a jagged scar, marking its territory with a dreadful demonstration of its power. It conjures up connotations of the supernatural, conveying menacing undertones typically associated with the horror genre. In contrast, the depiction of the claw in the Application Mark is likely to convey more specific, and closely inter-related, ideas to the average consumer, who is likely to understand the wording “TORONTO RAPTORS” to be the name of a sports team. The average consumer looking at the Application Mark is likely to think of a velociraptor’s claw gripping a basketball, the predatory vigour of the team players and perhaps the occasionally vicious nature of the competition between rival teams. The concept of aggression evoked by the Application Mark is inextricably tied to a particular sporting context. In short, the primary concept underlying the Opponent’s Marks is the idea of a mysterious and menacing creature, while the primary concept underlying the Application Mark is the athletic prowess of a specific basketball team. As such, I would conclude that these marks are conceptually dissimilar.","63 My conclusion on the absence of similarity between the competing marks means that it is unnecessary for me to proceed with Step 2 or Step 3 of the analytical framework for Section 8(2)(b). Nevertheless, in relation to Step 2, I would have found that the respective goods and services to which the competing markswere applied were indeed identical in some cases, and similar in other cases. The clearest examples would have been items like sunglasses (Class 9), printed matter and publications (Class 16), and clothing (Class 25). In relation to Step 3, I would have hesitated to find a likelihood of consumer confusion because, as I have explained earlier, average consumers in Singapore would have some general knowledge that would enable them to understand that the Application Mark relates to a basketball team, or some kind of sports team, even if they were unfamiliar with TORONTO RAPTORS as a specific NBA team. Bearing in mind that the likelihood of confusion inquiry in trade mark opposition proceedings must consider all notional fair uses of the Application Mark, the specifications of the trade mark application should be the starting point to determine the kinds of goods or services to which the Application Mark is potentially going to be applied; this would, in turn, enable us to identify the “likely characteristics of the relevant customers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase” (Staywell at [96(b)]). The underlined parts of the Application Mark’s specifications indicate a significant nexus to basketball-related products, services and merchandising. In my view, the “average consumer” in this case should be someone with at least some awareness of, or familiarity with, the sport. This “average consumer” is unlikely to be confused into thinking that goods or services bearing the Application Mark are supplied by the Opponent. Taken together with the various distinguishing features observable between the competing marks, the likelihood of average consumers confusing the Application Mark with the Opponent’s earlier trade marks, or assuming an economic linkage between the proprietors of these marks is, in my view, very low.","63 My conclusion on the absence of similarity between the competing marks means that it is unnecessary for me to proceed with Step 2 or Step 3 of the analytical framework for Section 8(2)(b).

12,Apple v Swatch,2018,Sgipos,OF,1,5,"29   I observe that the “THINK DIFFERENT” Mark comprises two English words in plain font with no significant design feature that catches the eye. Accordingly, I am persuaded that, visually, the Opponent’s Mark is of a normal level of technical distinctiveness. It therefore enjoys (only) a normal threshold before a competing mark, such as the Application Mark, would be considered visually dissimilar to it.

30 I also consider “distinctiveness” in the sense of whether the respective marks contain distinctive and dominant components, and if so, what these may be. Apprehending the “THINK DIFFERENT” Mark as an average consumer, I do not think there is a distinctive and dominant component as such. Rather, it is the mark as a whole, being the combination of two words, “THINK” and “DIFFERENT”, that makes an impact. Likewise for the “Tick different” Mark, it is distinctive as a whole. This finding applies to the three-fold assessment of marks-similarity: visually, aurally and conceptually.",3_3_4_2_X_3,"55 The conceptual dissimilarity of the marks is the starkest, and bears heavily on the impression of the average consumer. With this, accompanied by visual and aural dissimilarities to a lesser extent, I am persuaded that the average consumer would conclude that the marks are, overall, more dissimilar than similar.","33 As regards the Opponent’s argument that the difference between “Tick” and “THINK” lies only in the replacement of the letters “H” and “N” in the Opponent’s Mark, with the letter “c” in the Application Mark, I am not persuaded that the average consumer in Singapore would visually analyse the marks in this cold, clinical, bean-counting manner. This would be contrary to the principle summarised at [20(iv)] above. Rather, he or she would see “Tick” and “THINK” as whole words that first appear in their line of vision, and that visually signal the difference between the marks. Consumers who recall the strong visual impact of the upper case used in the Opponent’s Mark as opposed to the mostly lower case letters in the Application Mark would perceive the difference more acutely, while those who do not will still likely see the marks as different overall. However the consumer regards the marks visually in his imperfect recollection, I think the Application Markhas “distinguish(ed) itself sufficiently and substantially” from the Opponent’s Mark based on a normal threshold.

34   Thus, I find that the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Mark are rather more dissimilar than similar visually.

","44 Overall, I am persuaded that the “Tick different” Mark and the “THINK DIFFERENT” Mark are more aurally dissimilar than they are similar, even given that the Opponent’s Mark possesses a higher than normal level of technical distinctiveness. However, this dissimilarity is to a lesser extent than the visual dissimilarity (and conceptual dissimilarity, see below).","52 On the balance, I find that the marks are conceptually more dissimilar than similar, and to a higher degree than the visual and aural assessment.","71 This area is indeed a fertile field for ploughing and, perhaps, sectional harvest. However, this is not an issue that needs a decision today as marks-similarity was not established under Section 8(2)(b). Itherefore leave it to parties in future to present their best arguments to support the Court or this Tribunal in adjudication.","74 As there is no marks-similarity, an essential element of Section 8(2)(b) has not been made out.

Having assessed the marks visually, aurally, and conceptually, I find that the marks are more dissimilar than similar overall.","54 Having compared the marks visually, I consider that they are visually different. To summarise my reasons:","60   The Opponent did not have any submissions on the Syllables Approach. All I need to say about it is that “MONSTER ENERGY” is made up of 5 syllables, like so: “MON-STER EN-ER-GY”. As for “MONSTER CASTLE”, it is made up of 4 syllables, as follows: “MON-STER CAS-TLE”. The marks cannot be said to have more syllables in common than not.


61 For the above reasons, my view is that the marks are aurally more dissimilar than similar.","69 While I accept that the competing marks are conceptually different overall, I would not go so far as to say—which the Applicant invited me to—that the stylisation conveys the impression of cartoons, games and fairy tales. All that I will say about the stylisation is that it is consistent with, and does not detract from, the central concept.","73 In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step.

102 To conclude, I take the view that none of the “MONSTER ENERGY” (40201501193T) services in Class 41 are identical with or similar to the services for which registration is sought under the Application Mark in Class 42.","73 In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step."
16,Fox Head v Fox Street,2018,Sgipos,OS,3,7,"49 The distinctiveness of the Opponent’s earlier mark as a whole must be assessed. From an inherent perspective, the earlier mark is not just the word “Fox” in plain ordinary font but is composed of the stylistic elements mentioned at [46]. Although it is a common word that refers to an animal, the word is neither descriptive nor allusive in relation to the relevant goods. As such, I consider that it has an above average degree of distinctiveness.",7_7_10_10_9_7,"69 Earlier on, I have found that the respective marks are (a) visually similar to a high degree, (b) aurally identical and (c) conceptually identical. While bearing in mind that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" ([18] of Staywell), I find that the Application Mark and the earlier mark are similar to a high degree.","56 I now move to the Applicant’s point that colours in the Application Mark, and lack thereof in the earlier mark, render the marks visually different. I do not agree with the Applicant. The earlier mark is registered in black and white or, in other words, without colour as a feature of the mark. It is clear that registration of a mark in black and white covers use of the mark in colour. As such, it cannot be said that the colour of the Application Mark renders it visually different. The colour of the Application Mark in this case is irrelevant as the earlier mark is in black and white.

57  In light of the above, I find that the marks are visually similar to a high degree.

",63 I therefore find that the marks are aurally identical as both would be articulated as “Fox”.,"67 In light of the above, I find that there is conceptual identity between the marks as they share the dominant and distinctive concept of a fox.","72 In my view, the goods are highly similar as they are all items of clothing. Some of the goods are also identical, such as, “jackets” and “shirts”.","85 For the reasons given above, I find that that there is a likelihood of confusion between the Application Mark and the Opponent’s earlier mark. The ground of opposition under Section 8(2)(b) therefore succeeds."
18,Bridgestone v Deestone,2018,Sgipos,OF,2,X,"57   The Opponents tried to rely on the “STONE” element’s distinctiveness by virtue of its “longstanding use, sales figures and advertising expenditure in Singapore”[note: 11]. However, given my finding that the distinctiveness of the Opponents’ earlier marks does not lie in the “STONE” element alone but in the marks as a whole, I do not see how the distinctiveness of the Opponents’ earlier marks (whether inherent or enhanced through use) would assist the Opponents’ case.

",3_3_3_1_X_X,"79 I have found that the respective marks are (a) visually more dissimilar than similar; (b) aurally more dissimilar than similar and (c) conceptually dissimilar. While bearing in mind that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" ([18] of Staywell), I find that overall when observed in their totality, the Application Mark is more dissimilar rather than similar to either of the Opponents’ earlier marks.","69 In conclusion, while it is true that the competing marks each contain the same ending “STONE” and are thus visually similar to that extent, overall the marks are visually more dissimilar than similar, having regard to the fact that the difference in the appearance of the letters at the beginning of the marks, which are the first to hit the eye, creates a notable and striking point of visual contrast.","70 The Opponents’ case on aural similarity rests primarily on the point that “STONE” which is in common is the dominant component of the marks. However, again I do not see why “STONE” would be dominant from the aural perspective. All the marks consist of conjoined elements so consumers are likely to vocalise the marks in full. Whilst the last syllable of the marks is identical in sound there is no question that the markshave striking phonetic differences at the beginning i.e. the prefixes “DEE”, “BRIDGE” and “FIRE”. These prefixes are simple to pronounce and consist of sounds which are familiar to the public in Singapore. The fact that they appear right at the beginning also means that they will be audibly enunciated and not diminished in speech. Furthermore, in view that the first sound to hit the ear is the component that is different, the difference is not likely to go unnoticed.

71   In light of all of the above, I am of the view that the Application Mark is aurally more dissimilar than similar to the Opponents’ earlier marks.","77 Accordingly, in my view neither of the Opponents’ earlier marks are conceptually similar to the Application Mark.","83 In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step.","83 In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step."
19,Beats v LG,2016,Sgipos,OF,1,5 (applied not at the first step),"22 So, notwithstanding that, as re-iterated in Staywell at [25], “it is an integral factor in the marks-similarity inquiry”, the technical distinctiveness of the two marks must be considered in the abstract at this stage, ie without reference to the actual goods/services at issue. Appling this to the two marks before me, the Application Mark QuadBeat is an invented word and therefore has a considerable degree of inherent technical distinctiveness as it is “meaningless” (Staywell, at [24]), although is not without allusive impact if used in relation to audio products. On the other hand, depending on the goods/services in respect of which it is used the technical distinctiveness of the word BEATS could range from being inherently distinctive to being devoid of distinctive character: to take three examples in that range, it would have inherent technical distinctiveness in relation to clothing (as it has no reference to any character or quality of clothing), have relatively low inherent distinctiveness (by virtue of its highly allusive nature) in relation to audio electronic products and be descriptive if used as a trade mark for kitchen utensils that may be used for beating, such as whisks. For the avoidance of doubt, I should emphasise that I am not suggesting that the Opponent’s BEATS Mark is without distinctive character as a trade mark for the audio electronic products in respect of which it is registered: merely that the Court of Appeal in Staywell made clear, at [20]-[25], that the level of distinctiveness of the earlier mark in relation to the goods for which it is registered is an issue reserved for the likelihood of confusion enquiry, if it is reached.",3_3_3_3_X_X,"30 Weighing up carefully all three aspects of marks-similarity and making an overall valuation, I find that the Applicant’s mark QuadBeat and the Opponent’s BEATS Mark are dissimilar rather than similar.","25 Taking all these factors into account, I consider that from a visual perspective the two marks are clearly dissimilar rather than similar.","26 When considered from an aural perspective, both marks are word marks that are easily pronounced (subject to my comment below on possible sloppy pronunciation of the Application Mark). The Opponent’s BEATS Mark is comprised of one syllable, starting with the plosive consonant sound ‘b’ and terminating with the fricative consonant sound ‘s’; whereas the Application Mark is two syllables with equal stress on both, starting with the hard ‘kw’ consonant sound and ending with the plosive consonant sound ‘t’. To the extent that pronunciation of the Application Mark by an average consumer may be less than perfect, I would suggest that it is the second part ‘beat’ that may be swallowed in part and the plosive ‘t’ not enunciated properly or at all, resulting in an increased importance for the first word ‘quad’. Even if that common sense view is not correct and equal stress should be given to both syllables, from an aural perspective I consider the two marks are dissimilar rather than similar.","29 The Opponent relies in its Written Submissions on marks-similarity (at [31]) on the statement of George Wei J in Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd v Ceramiche Caesar SpA [2016] 2 SLR 1129 at [29] that “it follows that where the opponent’s mark has a feature that is clearly dominant and distinctive, the fact that this feature is also found in the applicant’s mark will naturally tend to support finding of overall similarity even if some other features are different”. I do not agree that this assists the Opponent at the marks-similarity stage: the Opponent’s BEATS Mark is a common, five-letter word which, although it may be or become distinctive as a trade mark, is not included in the Application Mark which is clearly different to it. Thus, I consider that the marks are dissimilar conceptually: one is an invented word each part of which (‘quad’ and ‘beat’) has a degree of possible allusive meaning (although the combination is meaningless); the other is a mark comprising a commonly used word that could have a number of allusive meanings.","35 Had it been necessary for me to do so, I would now have moved on to consider the goods-similarity and thereafter to an assessment of the likelihood of confusion. However, the marks are in my view so clearly dissimilar (rather than similar) that I do not consider any useful purpose is served by proceeding further with the three-step enquiry that ends with a consideration of whether there is a likelihood of confusion as a result of the mark and goods/services similarities, given that to do so would require me to assume a critical fact that I have found is lacking, ie marks-similarity, and without which there cannot be a likelihood of confusion. In the event of a successful appeal against my decision on marks-similarity, I do not consider that my view on whether or not there exists a likelihood of confusion if hypothetically the marks are viewed to be similar rather than dissimilar can or should be given any weight.","35 Had it been necessary for me to do so, I would now have moved on to consider the goods-similarity and thereafter to an assessment of the likelihood of confusion.

20,Monster v Mixi,2017,Sgipos,OF,3,5,"45 In summary, I find the technical distinctiveness of “MONSTER ENERGY” to be normal, or ordinary, in nature. While “MONSTER ENERGY” does not describe the goods for which it is registered, it certainly does not qualify as a mark that has greater technical distinctiveness. Consequently, it does not enjoy a high threshold before a competing sign (here: “MONSTER STRIKE”) will be considered dissimilar to it.",3_3_3_3_2_1,"73 Consequently, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step. Although my conclusion that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar means that I am not required to go on to the next step, I will do so for completeness and in case I am wrong on marks similarity.","54 In conclusion, while it is true that the competing marks each contain the same first element “MONSTER” and are thus visually similar to that extent, overall the marks are visually more dissimilar than similar, having regard to the fact that the second word in each mark is not at all similar to the other. Integral to my decision on this point is the finding that the element “MONSTER” is not the distinctive (in both the technical or non-technical senses of the word) and dominant component of either of the marks, and should not be given additional weight in the assessment.","61 To conclude, although I note that the competing marks both contain the same first word “MONSTER”, this word cannot be taken to be the dominant and distinctive element of the competing marks. Equal attention would be paid to the words “ENERGY” in the Opponent’s trade mark and “STRIKE” in the Application Mark. Those words, when spoken, are aurally different both in the way they are pronounced and in terms of the number of syllables they contain. In conclusion, the marks are aurally more dissimilar than they are similar.","69 When distilled to their respective essences, “MONSTER ENERGY” brings to mind something or someone that contains or possesses a great deal of energy, whereas “MONSTER STRIKE” evokes the image of awesome hitting force. Granted, energy is required to carry out a striking action, but the two are completely different concepts altogether. “MONSTER STRIKE” refers to a great action, whereas “MONSTER ENERGY” speaks of huge potential.

70   Overall, I find the marks to be conceptually more dissimilar than similar.","88 For the reasons set out above, I have no trouble arriving at the conclusion that the respective goods/services are dissimilar to a substantial degree. With the exception of Class 9, the goods and services are not even in the same classes. As for Class 9, the specification of the respective goods are obviously different.","108 Ultimately, I am not persuaded that there is sufficient evidence of use so as to be capable of constituting a “MONSTER” family or series of marks for the purposes of the assessment of the likelihood of confusion in this case. If the Applicant was applying to register the Application Mark for energy drinks, I could see how it could be arguable that there exists a “ ” family of marks which should be taken into account. (Although, of course, the earlier relevant trade marks in such a case would presumably be those registered in Class 32.) But the instant case is simply too far removed."
21,Polo/lauren v United Stated Polo,2015,Sgipos,OF,3,5,"79 Looking at the Application Mark as a whole, I find that neither the Double Horsemen Device nor the text “USPA” is more outstanding or memorable than the other. The factors of size, position and technical distinctiveness are all neutral. Neither component can be said to be much bigger in size than the other. Neither enjoys a more prominent position than the other in the mark. Both components have inherent technical distinctiveness.",5_5_0_10_10_0,"96 I have found that the marks are visually similar (to an extremely low degree) and conceptually identical. There is no aural similarity.

97   It is possible to find, in an overall assessment of the marks, that the marks are similar even if they are not similar in all three aspects: see [53(a)] above. Ultimately, the question is whether the two marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar, and answering this question is inevitably a matter of impression: see [53(b)] above. Looking at the two marks in their totality, I find that they are similar. The degree of similarity, though, is a very low one. Nevertheless, the first requirement in Section 8(2)(b) is satisfied in this case.","81 I must thus compare the Single Polo Player Mark against the Application Mark as a whole without giving special regard to either the device or the text in the Application Mark. In this comparison, I find that whilst there is a small degree of similarity between the devices, the presence of text “USPA” in the Application Mark significantly reduces this similarity. My conclusion is that there is only an extremely low degree of visual similarity between the two marks in this case.","86 These cases illustrate that the issue of whether there is aural similarity when one mark (or both) is a strictly pictorial device(s), is very fact-centric. As mentioned, the Opponents did not pursue the issue of aural similarity. They did not point to any evidence that would support their argument that the relevant public is likely to verbalise the Single Polo Player Mark as “polo player”. Indeed it seems to me that the evidence suggests otherwise. I have already indicated, in the visual comparison, that the Opponents had difficulties showing use of the Single Polo Player Mark on its own (see [73] above). For example, the vast majority of the sample invoices tendered as evidence of their sales in Singapore featured the Single Polo Player Mark used in conjunction with the words “POLO RALPH LAUREN”. If the Single Polo Player Mark is often used in conjunction with the Opponents’ word marks, it is likely that when the average consumer sees the Single Polo Player Mark on its own, he will verbalise it as “Polo Ralph Lauren mark”, and not “polo player” as the Opponents claimed.

87   I therefore find that there is no aural similarity in this case.","94 Just like in the visual comparison, I find that there is no dominant component in the Application Mark for the purposes of the conceptual comparison. Assessing the Application Mark as a whole, I find that the Double Horsemen Device (just like the Single Polo Player) conveys the idea of the game of polo. The presence of the text “USPA”, since there is no evidence that it has any meaning to the public in Singapore, does not add or subtract from this idea.

95   I therefore find that the two marks are conceptually identical.","100 In my view, the term “reading glasses” and “spectacles” are often used interchangeably. I find that there is identity between all the goods of the parties. Therefore, the second requirement in Section 8(2)(b) is satisfied in this case.","113 For completeness, I would add that confusion for the purposes of Section 8(2)(b) can be of two kinds: where the consumer thinks that the goods bearing the opposed mark are those of the registered proprietor of the earlier trade mark, or the consumer thinks that the parties using these two marks are economically-linked (Staywell at [99] and Hai Tong at [74]). In this case, I find that there is no likelihood of either type of confusion. Therefore, the third requirement in Section 8(2)(b) is not satisfied in this case."
22,Sports Connection v PT Eigerindo,2015,Sgipos,OS,1,,,6_7_8_7_5_6,"45 Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the Registered Mark and the Applicants' Mark have a substantial degree of aural similarity, and a moderate degree of visual and conceptual similarity. On the whole, I find that the similarity of the competing marks has been established for the purpose of Section 8(2)(b) of the Act.","38 Applying the principle of imperfect recollection of the consumer, that ""comparisons are usually made from memory, removed in time and space from the actual marks in question"" (Sarika (CA) at [18]), and that the competing marks are not to be compared or assessed side by side and examined in detail for the sake of isolating particular points of difference (Hai Tong at [40] cited above at paragraph [24]), I find that the general impression that would be likely left in the mind of the consumer is that the competing marks are visually similar. The letters in ""BODYPAC"" and ""BODYPACK"" share the same letters (as indicated in bold and underlined) except for the last letter, ""K"". Given the difference of only the final letter, and the fact that the final letter does not add any particular visual significance to the dominant component, I find that the average consumer is likely to find that the competing marks are visually similar.","42 Following from these cases, I consider how the average consumer would pronounce or recall the Registered Mark in his imperfect recollection. The Registered Mark comprises of the word ""Bodypack"" and ""digital case"", where the latter appears in much smaller font and in a position subordinate to the former. As such, I find that the average consumer is likely to pronounce or recall only the dominant component of the Registered Mark, which is ""Bodypack"". Both the dominant word components of the competing marks have 3 syllables, all of which sound alike (ie. ""BO""-""DY"" -""PACK"" / ""BO""-""DY"" -""PAC""). I accept the Applicants' submission that the letter ""K"" contained in the Registered Mark does not make any discernible aural difference to its pronunciation because it produces the same sound as the letter ""C"". Given the aural similarity in pronunciation of the competing marks, I find that they share a very high degree of aural similarity.","44 The competing marks, ""BODYPACK"" and ""BODYPAC"" would appear to the average consumer as two words, ""BODY"" and ""PACK"", that have been put together to convey the impression of a ""pack"" or something similar such as a ""pouch"" or other small bag that can be slung across or carried on the ""body"". Given that ""PAC"" is meaningless in and of itself, the average consumer may think of it as either a ""PACK"" (by mental association with the word ""PACK""), therefore giving it the same conceptual meaning, or the average consumer may think of it as a word used to describe some type of gear that is used or carried or associated with the ""body"". The words ""digital case"" in the Registered Mark may convey the concept of it being a case for digital products that is a subset of a pack for the body (e.g. a handphone pouch slung across the body, or a laptop case strapped to the body). In my mind, it does not change the general concept of the mark such as to render it conceptually different from the Applicants' Mark. I find that the competing marks are therefore conceptually similar.","68     After examining the various specifications in light of the considerations above, I find that the following goods in the Registered Proprietors' specification in Class 25 are similar to that of the Applicants' goods in Class 18:

Bandanas [neckerchiefs], beach clothes, beach shoes, boots,boots for sports, boots (iron fittings for-), boots (welts for-), cap peaks, caps [headwear], clothing, clothing for gymnastics, coats, cyclists' clothing, fishing vests, fittings of metal for shoes and boots, football boots, football shoes, footwear, footwear (tips for-), footwear uppers, gaiters, gloves [clothing], gymnastic shoes, hats, headbands [clothing], headgear for wear, heelpieces for boots and shoes, inner soles, jackets [clothing], jackets (stuff-) [clothing], jerseys [clothing], jumpers [shirt fronts], motorists' clothing, non-slipping devices for boots and shoes, outerclothing, pants, ready-made clothing, sandals, shoes, shoes (iron fittings for-), shoes (non-slipping devices for-), shoes (welts for-), shoulder wraps, shower caps, ski boots, skirts, skull caps, sock suspenders, socks, soles for footwear, sports (boots for-), sports jerseys, sports shoes, stocking suspenders, stocking, stockings (sweat-absorbent-), straps (gaiter-), studs for football boots [shoes], stuff jackets [clothing], suits (bathing-), sun visors, sweat-absorbent underclothing [underwear], sweaters, swimsuits, Tee-shirts, tips for footwear, trunks (bathing-), underclothing, underclothing (anti-sweat-), vests, vests (fishing-), waterproof clothing; all included in Class 25.(""Class 25 Similar Goods"")

69     However, I find it difficult to imagine that some of these goods, e.g. ""bath sandals"", ""heels"", ""underpants"" or ""neckties"" have both fashion and sports utility. Whilst I am open to the Applicants' suggestion that there may be a possibility of ""brand licensing"" or ""sister branding"" between fashion and sports merchandise, there is no evidence to substantiate this proposition. To call these items ""sports merchandise"" would, as phrased by the High Court in Festina at [73] (cited above at paragraph [57]), ""put an unnatural strain on the average consumer's perception"" of what sports merchandise are. It is quite unlikely that these goods, which can perhaps be found in purely fashion-focused stores and/or the general shoes/underwear/accessories sections in department stores, will also be found in sports stores or in the sports section of department stores.   In the absence of any evidence, I am not able to find the link between sports and fashion, as suggested in a bare statement by the Applicants.

70     Therefore, I find that the following goods in the Registered Proprietors' specification in Class 25 are dissimilar to that of the Applicants' specification in Class 18:

bath sandals, bath slippers, belts [clothing], belts (money-) [clothing], braces for clothing [suspenders], clothing of imitations of leather, clothing of leather, coats (top-), esparto shoes or sandals; heelpieces for stockings, heels, hoods [clothing], knitwear [clothing], lace boots,layettes [clothing], linen (body-) [garments], mittens, money belts [clothing], neckties, overalls, overcoats, pajamas (Am.), parkas, pullovers, pyjamas, ready-made linings [parts of clothing], scarves, shirt fronts, shirts yokes, shirts, slips [undergarments], trouser straps, trousers, underpants, underwear, uniforms, visors [hatmaking], waistcoats. (""Class 25 Dissimilar Goods"")","79 Given the degree of similarity between the competing marks and the permissible extraneous factors in relation to both marks similarity and goods similarity on consumer confusion, I find that there is a likelihood of confusion between the Applicants' Mark and the Registered Mark, as regards Class 18 and the Class 25 Similar Goods. The third limb of the test under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act is satisfied to this extent."
23,Polo/lauren v United Stated Polo,2016,Sghc,OF,3,3,"15 In this regard, I do not find the distinction which the plaintiff drew between invented words and acronyms, for which no authority was cited in support, to be persuasive. I cannot see why an invented word would have a greater capacity to function as a badge of origin as opposed to an acronym, particularly where both are pronounceable and have no inherent meaning. Neither do I see any error in the Adjudicator’s finding that the Application Device and the Application Text “compare[d] well” in size, certainly not to any extent that would render her finding as to the lack of a dominant component in the Application Mark to be erroneous. While the Application Text may have been smaller than the Application Device, as the Adjudicator notes at [71] of the IPOS Decision, it was in a highly prominent location, lying adjacent to the Application Device, and was of a size sufficient to stand out on its own. For these reasons, I am similarly of the view that there are no dominant components in the Application Mark.",5_2_0_10_9_0,"39 The plaintiff submits that the Adjudicator instead “approached the criteria of visual, aural and conceptual similarities in a formulaic manner”. In my view, there is nothing to substantiate this contention. It is apparent that the Adjudicator was cognisant of the test in June Perfect; [97] of the IPOS Decision ([1] supra) explicitly states that “[u]ltimately, the question is whether the two marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar, and answering this question is inevitably a matter of impression”. Adopting the same approach, I find myself arriving at the same conclusion as the Adjudicator – the marks are similar on the whole, but only to a low degree.","18 Given that I am also of the view that there are no dominant components in the Application Mark, I agree with the Adjudicator that there was only an extremely low degree of visual similarity between the Application Mark and the Opposition Mark. Other than the fact that the Application Device and the Opposition Mark are only slightly similar (the former comprises two polo players on horseback, of which one appears to be in lighter-coloured attire and is holding the mallet facing downwards), the prominence and inherent distinctiveness of the Application Text do significantly reduce the visual similarity between the marks.","24 Putting aside the fact that APB does not bind me, it is clear that this holding in APB was premised on the graphical device being the dominant component of the mark, the Registrar having found that the words “BIERE LARUE” was “the secondary element in the [a]pplicants’ mark”: APB at [36]. As I have already found above, I am of the view that neither the Application Device nor the Application Text is the dominant component of the Application Mark. That being the case, I did not see any particular reason why the reasonable consumer would choose to pronounce the Application Mark as “polo-players” rather than as “USPA”, which while invented, is not unpronounceable. As counsel for the defendant highlighted in his oral submissions, no one has sought to pronounce Nike’s “Swoosh” device even though it is only accompanied by the text “NIKE”, which the public may not know to be a Greek goddess.","10 Since the defendant accepts that the Application Mark and the Opposition Mark are conceptually identical, that is also not a matter which requires my consideration.","5 There was no dispute that the Opposition Mark, which was applied for on 14 May 1996, is an “earlier trade mark” under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA. The Adjudicator held that there was “only an extremely low degree of visual similarity between the two marks in this case” and no aural similarity between the Application Mark and the Opposition Mark (the IPOS Decision at [81] and [87]). Nevertheless, she found the marks to be conceptually identical and on the whole, she was of the view the marks were similar, albeit to a very small degree (the IPOS Decision at [95] and [97]). She also found identity between all the goods of the parties (the IPOS Decision at [100]). Because of the low degree of similarity between the marks and the nature of the goods, which in the Adjudicator’s view would involve a higher degree of care being exercised in their purchase, she found that there was no likelihood of confusion under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA and accordingly dismissed that ground of the plaintiff’s opposition. This forms the sole basis for the plaintiff’s appeal before me. As the defendant does not contest the identity of goods, I need only consider the similarity of the marks and the likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.","44 Taking into account the low degree of similarity between the trade marks, particularly in respect of visual similarity, and the greater attention that the average consumer is likely to pay when purchasing eyewear, I find that there exists no likelihood of confusion on the part of the public under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA. I therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the defendant."
24,"Polo/lauren v Royal County
This case has comparisons of 3 sets of trademarks",2017,Sgipos,OF,3,5,"30 I am unable to agree with the Proprietor that the Applicant’s Earlier Marks lack distinctiveness. Firstly, there is no application by the Proprietor to invalidate the Applicant’s trade marks for being devoid of distinctive character, descriptive or generic. The Applicant's Earlier Marks must therefore enjoy a “presumption of validity” and be considered to have at least a minimum degree of inherent distinctiveness. Secondly, even if I accept that the word “Polo” will be perceived by the public as referring to the game of polo, there is no evidence that the Applicant’s goods are intended for use in horse riding or the playing of polo. In fact, the Applicant’s specification of goods for the “POLO” word marks in Class 25 specifically excludes goods adapted for use in horse riding or the playing of polo. As for the point that the word “Polo” may refer to a kind of collared T-shirt (commonly referred to as “Polo” shirts), I accept that in relation to “polo shirts” and “t-shirts” the inherent distinctiveness of the Word Mark is extremely low but with regard to all other goods in Classes 9, 18 and 25, I find that the Applicant’s Earlier Marks have a normal degree of inherent distinctiveness. Considering the fact that the word “polo” is not an invented word and a device of a polo player is not one with a high level of imaginative content (being something that exists in reality and not an arbitrary graphic creation), I do not think that their distinctiveness is any higher than normal.",3_2_3_3_10_0,"97   I have found that the respective marks are (a) visually more dissimilar than similar; (b) aurally neutral; and (c) conceptually more dissimilar than similar.

98   I have found earlier that the composite marks are (a) visually similar to a low degree; (b) aurally more dissimilar than similar; and (c) are conceptually more dissimilar than similar. Bearing in mind that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" ([18] of Staywell), and that a finding of similarity of marks can be made even though not all three aspects of similarity are established, I find that overall there is a low degree of similarity between the marks.

72 I come to the view that the marks have a low degree of visual similarity.

76   As such, I see no visual similarity between the Word Mark and the Subject Mark.","79   I am unable to agree with the Applicant. In my view, no aural comparison may be undertaken for this set of marks as the Device Mark, being a device only mark has no verbal element to speak of. At the very most, its visual or conceptual content can be described orally. The ‘meaning’ that the image evokes, or its ‘description’, will be assessed visually and conceptually but they will not be subject to a phonetic comparison or it will only repeat the outcome of the visual or conceptual comparison respectively, where these elements have already been assessed. This view was also expressed by the Honourable Justice Lee Seiu Kin in Polo HC at [22] where he said:

… Whether a mark that is found to have no aural component may nonetheless be found to be aurally similar to another mark does not appear to be settled law; for example, in Rovio Entertainment Ltd v Kimanis Food Industries Sdn Bhd [2014] SGIPOS 10, the principal assistant registrar found that there could be no aural similarity given that the mark which the opponent sought to rely on had no aural component. This aspect of the decision was undisputed and was therefore not disturbed in the appeal to the High Court: Rovio Entertainment Ltd v Kimanis Food Industries Sdn Bhd [2015] 5 SLR 618 at [85]. Personally, I have my reservations. To find aural similarity where no aural component exists seems to allow for visual or conceptual similarity to be accounted for within the assessment of aural similarity.

80   What this means is that this aspect of comparison results in a neutral conclusion rather than the marks are aurally dissimilar.

87   As a result, whether applying the Dominant Component Approach or the Quantitative Assessment Approach, the marks are aurally more dissimilar than similar.

89   While I agree that the Word Mark would be referred to as “Polo”, for the reasons stated at [85] and [86], I am of the view that the Subject Mark is more likely to be referred to as “Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club” or “Royal County of Berkshire” for short. Again, whether applying the Dominant Component Approach or the Quantitative Assessment Approach, the marks are aurally more dissimilar than similar.

","94   I bear in mind the Applicant’s submission that the idea of a polo club situated within a certain geographical location does not change its basic meaning, which evokes the idea of the game of polo. However, given the Court of Appeal’s exhortation in Staywell that greater care is needed in considering what the conceptually dominant component of a composite mark is, because the idea connoted by each component might be very different from the sum of its parts (Staywell at [35]), I do not think it would be correct for me to focus on the idea of the game of polo without considering the ideas given by the other elements of the mark. Taken together with the other elements of the mark, namely, the words “Royal County of Berkshire” and “POLO CLUB”, I am of the view that the Subject Mark evokes the idea of a place or location or, also, a particular polo club.

95   All things considered, overall, I find the marks to be conceptually more dissimilar than similar.","103 The Proprietor does not dispute that there is similarity in the goods[note: 27]. In my view the goods are not just similar but at least for the goods indicated in bold, they are also identical. For reasons of procedural economy, I will not undertake a full comparison of all the goods. Instead I will first assess the invalidation in relation to the items in bold which are obviously identical to those covered by the earlier trade marks. If the invalidation fails where the goods are identical, it follows that it will also fail where the goods are only similar.","129   Taking all the above factors into account, I find that even allowing for the identity of the goods and taking into account the doctrine of imperfect recollection, the fact that:

(a)   there is only a low degree of similarity between the marks;

(b)   a medium level of attention will be paid by consumers when purchasing such goods; and

(c)   goods of this type are usually bought after a visual inspection of the goods or from the Internet;

there is no likelihood of confusion arising, whether it be confusion as to origin from the same source or confusion as to the origins of goods bearing the respective marks being economically linked. Even if there is some possibility of initial interest confusion between the marks, it is clear from Staywell at [116] that initial interest confusion does not constitute confusion for the purpose of Section 8(2) of the Act. This element is thus not made out and the ground of invalidation under the Similarity Ground therefore fails."
25,Bacardi v G3,2015,Sgipos,OF,3,5,"37 However, the above has to be seen together with the fact that there are 29 establishments which serve the Opponents’ products as it is clear that in such establishments, the Opponents’ products, unlike those sold via the retail channel, are not sold via bottles, but by glasses. This means that the sale of one bottle from the distributor to a food and beverage establishment can be translated into several glasses of the Opponents’ products which in turn means that the Opponents’ products will enjoy more exposure than what the sales figures reflect (which are presumably sales in bottles or cartons but in any event not in glasses). However, the significance of the evidence ends here. I am of the view that to show that the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A has acquired a high level of technical distinctiveness, more is required. In light of the above, I am unable to agree with the Opponents’ argument at paragraph 42 of their written submissions that the [Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A] enjoys a high degree of technical distinctiveness such that a higher threshold must be met before a competing sign would be considered dissimilar to it.",5_5_5_5_6_0,"60 In light of the analysis above, I am of the view that the marks are similar visually, aurally and conceptually to a low extent. Therefore, on the whole, I am of the view that the marks are similar in totality, albeit only to a low extent.","46   I also note that the font of the word “MARTINI” in the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A is of a bold and strong font, while the words “LOUIS.M.MARTINI” is of a softer, less intense font. In relation to the issue of the font of the words, the Opponents also sought to argue, at paragraph 39 of their written submissions, quoting [34] of Doctor’s Associates Inc v Lim Eng Wah (trading as Subway Niche) [2012] 3 SLR 193 (“Subway”) that “trade mark protection may not be circumscribed simply by tweaking the font or style of the lettering of the word mark, particularly where one had deliberately registered the word mark in block letters to represent that the distinctiveness of the mark lies in the word itself”. This proposed application of the said principle for the current case is clearly misguided. This principle is not applicable in relation to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A in this instance as the said mark is not a word mark simplicter but a composite mark. The principle that registration in bold font includes registration in all fonts is only applicable for registration of a mark which only includes words per se. In this regard, I note that in Subway, the marks which were alleged to have been infringed are all word marks registered in block letters (see [4] of Subway which listed (i) T8903282C; (ii) T0511829B; and (iii) T0511831D).

47   Having regard to all of the above considerations, I am of the view that the marks are only visually similar to a low extent.","51   It is clear from the Hans case that words which are in much smaller fonts and in relatively less prominent positions are not taken into account in construing aural similarity. The current case is clearly different. In fact, the word ""LOUIS” is similar to the word ""MARTINI"" in terms of size and font, while the letter “M” is only of a slightly smaller size and font. Thus they cannot be disregarded in assessing aural similarity and due regard has to be given to these words.

52   In light of the above, I am of the view that there is aural similarity but only to a low extent.","57   Finally, in relation to the device in the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A, I am of the view that the strong lines and shapes together with the strong and bold font of the word “MARTINI” cause the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A to exude a bold and strong connotation. On the other hand, the font of the words “LOUIS.M.MARTINI” in the Application Mark is much softer and less intense, and thus consequently imbuing the Application Mark with a much softer feel.

58   Taking all of the above into consideration, I am of the view that the marks are conceptually similar to a low extent.","82   In light of the above, I am unable to agree with the Applicants’ submissions at paragraph 43 of their written submissions that there is only a small overlap in the goods such that the Opponents cannot object to the Application Mark being protected for alcoholic beverages that are not “vermouth”, or “sparkling wine”. As alluded to above, “vermouth” and “sparkling wine” can be considered to be similar to other items under the broad term “alcoholic beverages (except beers)”. In this regard, I agree with the Opponents at paragraphs 29 and 30 of their supplementary written submissions that to the extent that the goods do not overlap, they are similar.

83   Thus I am of the view that this element has been satisfied.","111   In summary, I find that there is no likelihood of confusion between the Application Mark and the Opponents’ Earlier Mark T0508163A. The competing marks share, at best, a low degree of similarity. As regards the goods of interest, which have been found to be identical or similar in nature, the impact of this identity or similarity between them is reduced by the fact that the competing marks share a low degree of similarity and because the very nature of the goods is such that they would tend to command a greater degree of fastidiousness on the part of prospective purchasers while the nature of the consumer is such that he is likely to pay more attention when buying the goods in question. The average Singaporean consumer for alcoholic beverages (except beers) is reasonably knowledgeable and discerning about such alcoholic beverages and would thus make a considered decision before committing to a purchase in a supermarket or food and beverage establishment, thus greatly lessening any impact of goods similarity.

112   Thus in light of all of the above, on balance, taking into account the permissible extraneous factors, I find that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion."
26,Christie v Chritrs,2016,Sgipos,OF,1,,,5_6_2_2_X_2,"78 I have found that the marks are not aurally or conceptually similar, and that there is only a low to medium degree of visual similarity. Overall, I find that there is only a very low degree of similarity between the marks.","71 I am of the view that the cases relied upon by the Opponents can be distinguished as the relevant marks in those cases all differ by only 1 letter. Nevertheless, I find that there is a low to medium degree of visual similarity between the Application Mark and the Opponents’ “CHRISTIE’S” mark.","75 I agree with the Applicants that the Application Mark “Chritrs” is unpronounceable. I note that this was also the finding in the Domain Name Decision (“The essential part of the domain name, CHRITRS, is a collision of consonants. The Panel cannot agree with the Complainant that only ‘minor differences’ separate CHRITRS and CHRISTIE’S. The Panel struggles to see how CHRITRS might be pronounced.”) and the Hong Kong Judgment (the court opined at [19(v)] that CHRITRS “has no proper pronunciation.”). I do not think it is permissible to take one of several hypothetically plausible pronunciations of the Application Mark, then assert that that specific pronunciation is similar to “CHRISTIE’S”. I find that there is no aural similarity between the marks.","76   I agree with the Applicants that, conceptually, the impression the Application Mark “Chritrs” leaves on the average consumer is that of an unpronounceable invented word: see Applicants’ Written Submissions at [7]. In contrast, the Opponents’ Mark “CHRISTIE’S” is likely to be associated with a person, and indeed, I note that “CHRISTIE’S” is the surname of the Opponents’ founder.

77   Accordingly, I find that the marks are not conceptually similar.","114   However, without a clearly-reasoned basis as to how the relevant provisions in the Act can be interpreted to permit partial oppositions, the above concerns standing on their own may not withstand rigorous legal scrutiny. Given my finding that the parties’ services of interest are not similar, and my further finding discussed below that there would in any event not be any likelihood of confusion, it is unnecessary for me to reach a final decision on whether the Registrar has the power to allow a partial opposition. In view of the importance of this issue, I prefer to leave the matter open for consideration in a subsequent case, hopefully with the benefit of full submissions by the relevant parties.

Likelihood of Confusion

115   In case I am wrong that the parties’ services of interest are not similar, I now proceed to consider whether there is a likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act.","118 How would this affect the inquiry as to likelihood of confusion? In auctions, the reliability of the service provider is of critical importance. The end user has to rely on the service provider to ensure that the product he bids for is the same as the product he will receive in the event he is successful in the bid (or indeed that he will receive any product at all). In my view, it is likely that consumers are likely to be attentive to the identity of the service provider. Given the very low degree of similarity between the parties’ marks, I find that there is no likelihood of confusion."
27,Apple v Xiaomi,2017,Sgipos,OF,1,,,3_3_3_2_X_2,"66 Earlier on, I have found that the respective marks are (a) visually more dissimilar than similar; (b) aurally more dissimilar than similar and (c) conceptually not similar. While bearing in mind that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" ([18] of Staywell), I find that the Application Mark and the “IPAD” Mark are dissimilar rather than similar in their totality.","51 In light of all the above, I am of the view that the Application Mark and the “IPAD” Mark are visually more dissimilar than similar.","58 In light of all of the above, I am of the view that the Application Mark is aurally more dissimilar to the “IPAD” Mark than similar.",64 Accordingly in my view “IPAD” and “MI PAD” are not conceptually similar.,"28   There are clear overlaps between the Applicant’s goods and services and the Opponent’s goods and services.

29   The Applicant makes no submissions as regards the issue of whether the Applicant’s goods and services are identical with or similar to those for which the “IPAD” Mark is protected.

30   For reasons of procedural economy, I will not undertake a full comparison of the goods and services. Instead I will first assess the opposition in relation to the above items where the contested goods and services are obviously identical to those covered by the earlier trade marks. (For the avoidance of doubt, this does not mean that the identical goods and services are limited to the above list nor that the remaining goods and services in the Application Mark are not similar to the earlier marks.) If the opposition fails where the respective goods and services are identical, it follows that it will also fail where the respective goods and services are only similar.","92 Having considered the case as a whole, on the evidence submitted and taking into account the permissible extraneous factors, I do not consider that this element has been made out, whether it be confusion as to origin or confusion as to being economically linked."
28,Societe Des Produits v Liwayway,2014,Sgipos,OF,3,,,3_3_7_2_7_3,"48      Earlier on, I have found that the respective marks were not visually nor conceptually similar but as a matter of ""first impression"" may be aurally similar.  Given that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" ([18] of Staywell), I venture to say that the Application Mark and the Opponents' SMARTIES marks are dissimilar rather than similar in their totality.","35 I have considered the parties' submissions in light of the guidelines on visual similarity in Ferrero. Length-wise, as the Applicants have pointed out, the Application Mark is shorter, with 6 letters, compared to the 8-letter word ""SMARTIES"" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks. Structurally, from the perspective of ""whether there are the same number of words"", the respective marks each contain one word. From another structural perspective, taking into account how each mark is composed, I find that all the visual elements, such as shapes, colours and layout, in Trade Mark Nos. T9803132Z and T0808179I combine to produce a substantial visual impact that differentiates the Application Mark from the Opponents' SMARTIES marks. Finally, the issue whether the same letters are used in the marks is to be considered. Comparing the 6-letter Application Mark and the 8-letter word ""SMARTIES"" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks, there are 5 letters in common, namely ""M"", ""A"", ""R"", ""T"" and ""S"". Conversely, the respective marks differ from each other in 4 letters, namely ""Y"", ""S"", ""I"" and ""E"". This exercise is conducted at a high degree of granularity, but it must be borne in mind that the objective of comparing the marks for common letters is to help ascertain whether these marks can be said to be visually similar as wholes. That there are more letters in common than not does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the marks are therefore similar. Here, the beginnings of the respective marks are different; the marks begin with very different letters ""M"" and ""S"". The representation of the letter ""Y"" in the Application Mark is also visually striking, contributing to a distinguishable visual impact as compared with the Opponents' SMARTIES marks. In the present case, I am persuaded by the Applicants' submissions that the Application Mark is not visually similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.","40      As opined by Luxmoore LJ and cited with approval by the House of Lords in Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld [1945] RPC 65, 72, ""the answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another… must nearly always depend on first impression."" When the respective marks here are pronounced, it does appear to me that there is significant aural overlap.  Although the first – and more heavily stressed – syllables of the marks are not identical, they are similar because of the common sound ""MAR"" which tends to be prolonged in pronunciation.  As for the endings of the marks, they are indubitably identical.

41      As a matter of ""first impression"", the Application Mark may be aurally similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.","42      The Opponents have not made specific submissions on this issue, and perhaps understandably so.  On the other hand, the Applicants assert that the word ""MARTY"" in the Application Mark is a short form of the name ""Martin"".  The presence of "" 'S "" after the name ""Marty"" indicates a possessive noun; hence suggesting that the products belong to or are produced by ""Marty"".  This meaning contrasts with the meaning of the word ""SMARTY"", being the singular form of the word ""SMARTIES"" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.  The Applicants point out that the word ""SMARTY"" means ""smart aleck"", which in turn means ""an obnoxiously conceited and self-asserted person with pretensions to smartness or cleverness"".

43      I am persuaded by the Applicants' submissions above and conclude that there is no conceptual similarity between the Application Mark and the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.","55      Upon a comparison of the respective goods claimed, I find that there is substantial identity (goods under the Application Mark which are in common with the Opponents' specifications are underlined above), for example, in the items: fruits, vegetables, jellies, jams, eggs, milk, confectionery, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, rice and cakes.  Some of the remaining non-identical goods can also be said to be similar.

56      Accordingly, I am satisfied that the second element of identity or similarity of goods under Section 8(2)(b) is made out.","75 On balance, taking into account the permissible extraneous factors, I do not find a reasonable likelihood of confusion that goods bearing the Application Mark and the Opponents' SMARTIES marks emanate from the same undertaking or from economically linked undertakings."

As for the Subject Mark compared with the Applicants’ “FORTUNE” Marks, I am prepared to find that there is marginal conceptual similarity.","59      In respect of the element of similarity of goods, the Applicants made submissions on the Applicants’ Marks in Class 16 (in particular T7874671D, T5620304A and T6640561E) and not on the remaining earlier marks set out at [8] above, including those in Class 9. The Proprietor admits that the respective goods are goods of the same description and similar; and I agree that this is the case.","90 The competing marks are only conceptually (as opposed to visually and aurally) similar, and marginally so (for the purpose of analysis under the element of “likelihood of confusion”). Goods-wise, the consumer is likely to exercise a sufficient degree of care in selecting reading content of interest to him.On balance, taking into account all the permissible extraneous factors, I do not find a reasonable likelihood of confusion that goods bearing the Subject Mark and the Applicants’ “FORTUNE” Marks emanate from the same undertaking or from economically linked undertakings."
30,Seiko v Choice Fortune,2014,Sgipos,OF,1,,,5_5_5_3_6_3,"58 Earlier on, I have found that the competing marks are visually and aurally similar to a low degree but not conceptually similar. I also consider that the earlier mark “SEIKO” carries a relatively high degree of distinctiveness.Given that ""trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry"" and that “technical distinctiveness is an integral factor in the marks-similarity inquiry” (respectively [18] and [25] of Staywell), I conclude that the Application Mark and the Opponents' SEIKO Marks ""when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar"", but only marginally.","37      The assessment of mark-similarity is more an art than a science, more of feel than of formula, though guided by principles.  Overall, taking into account the foregoing considerations, I find that the Application Mark is visually similar to the Opponents' SEIKO Marks to a low degree.","43      Overall, as a matter of ""first impression"", I find that the Application Mark is aurally similar to the Opponents' SEIKO Marks to a low degree.","52      Thus, returning to the competing marks in question, I would not dismiss immediately the Opponents’ suggestion that consumers are likely to apprehend both marks as foreign words.  However, I would probe further and seek to uncover what idea or notion is borne by this seemingly foreign quality.  Having considered the marks “SEIKI” and “SEIKO”, I fail to see a more defined connotation in either of them.  The conceptual suggestion of “Japanese-ness” is too nebulous in the present case.  Being Japanese-like can mean different things to different consumers.  To one, it could bring to mind kawaii, a specific quality of cuteness in Japanese culture.  To another, it may carry allusions to Japanese restraint and resilience.  To yet another, it may hark of futuristic concepts and robotic technology.  In the absence of a sufficiently defined concept of being Japanese-like that is relevant and consistently perceived in the present case, I would agree with the Applicants that the marks are conceptually neutral.

53      Thus, I conclude that “SEIKI” and “SEIKO” are not conceptually similar.","61      The Applicants are right in that class headings do not necessarily cover all goods in the class.  However, the phrase “apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of sound or images” under the Opponents’ earlier trade mark T0415052D appears broad enough to overlap with the Application Goods, namely “Television sets; liquid crystal display televisions; disc players with DVD and optical disc format that uses a blue-violet laser; combo drive with optical disc format that uses a blue-violet laser"".  In view of the Applicants’ concession at the hearing that the goods were at most similar, I shall not dwell further on this point.

62      I find that the respective goods are similar and that the second element under Section 8(2)(b) has been satisfied.","84      On balance, taking into account the permissible extraneous factors, I do not find a reasonable likelihood of confusion that goods bearing the Application Mark and the Opponents' SEIKO Marks emanate from the same undertaking or from economically linked undertakings."
31,Apptitude v MGG,2016,Sgipos,OF,3,,,2_3_6_4_7_3,"Conclusion: the marks are highly dissimilar

63   I have found that: (a) visually, the marks are dissimilar to a substantial degree; (b) there is some aural similarity between the marks; and (c) there is no conceptual similarity between the marks. When I weigh all three aspects of marks-similarity (viz. the visual, aural and conceptual), I find that the Application Mark, as a whole, to be highly dissimilar to the SNAC Mark.

64   In arriving at my conclusion, I am aware that in Staywell, the competing marks had no visual similarity (a point which was not appealed and therefore not before the Court of Appeal), and the Court of Appeal considered the marks to have “a fair degree of conceptual similarity” and a “substantial degree of aural similarity”. In that case, the Court of Appeal had “no difficulty finding that the marks were similar”. This shows, of course, that marks which are visually dissimilar may yet be similar overall. However, each case must necessarily turn on its own facts and I cannot see how the aural similarity between the competing marks in this case is sufficient to render the marks similar as a whole, given my findings on the visual and conceptual aspects of the inquiry.","34   I find that the marks are visually substantially dissimilar as a whole, notwithstanding that both marks share the letter string “SNA” / “sna”. My reasons are as follows.

(a)   The letters “S-N-A-C” in the Opponent’s SNAC Mark are each of equal size and are each represented by a different colour. Visually, each and every letter in the mark is equal importance. “SNAC” is an invented word, and the distinctive character of the Opponent’s SNAC Mark resides in “SNAC” as a whole. I cannot simply ignore the “C” in “SNAC” and undertake the comparison on the basis of “SNA”. The overall visual impression, having regard also to the doctrine of imperfect recollection, is that the marks are substantially dissimilar.

(b)   The dominant component in the Application Mark is “snaapp”. The term “snaapp” is also not a word in the English language and, being an invented word, is inherently distinctive. As touched on briefly at [32] above, “snaapp” simply cannot be arbitrarily dissected into “sna” and “app” for the purposes of the comparison. The fact that each of the letters “s”, “n” and “a” appear in shades of blue and the subsequently letters “a”, “p” and “p” appear in the same maroon colour does not change the foregoing analysis.

(c)   Although it would be wrong (for the reasons stated above) for me to pay special attention to the letters “SNA” / “sna”, even if I were to proceed on that erroneous basis, the fact remains that “sna” is but three letters out of six in the “snaapp” component of the Application Mark. While the analysis is ultimately qualitative rather than quantitative, I note that the dominant component of the Application Mark (i.e. “snaapp”) contains six letters whereas “SNAC” consists of four letters. These differences point towards the conclusion that the marks are dissimilar.

(d)   As regards the words “SCHOOL NOTIFICATION & ATTENDANCE APP”, the Opponent rightly pointed out that they would have limited visual impact. However, this does not mean that their presence is to be disregarded altogether. These words contribute to the overall visual impression that the Application Mark “has more components and is visibly more complex and longer than” the Opponent’s SNAC Mark.[note: 34]

(e)   It is true that four colours are used in the SNAC Mark and that the Application Mark also has four colours. But it is not the number of colours that is determinative. I must also consider what colours have been used and how the use of colour feeds into the overall impression on the eye of the consumer. In this case, the colours reinforce my conclusion that the marks are, as a whole, visually substantially dissimilar.","56   Returning to the present case, I have found the earlier trade mark would be pronounced as “snac” or “snack” (see [47] above). As for the Application Mark, the parties appear to be in agreement that it should be pronounced as “snap”. Because “SNAC” and “snaapp” are each one word, the London Lubricant principle should apply. Having regard to the tendency of speakers (especially in Singapore) to slur the endings of words in the English language, the respective marks would be pronounced in a monosyllabic manner (“snap” versus “snac” or “snack”) with the same identical sibilant starting sound (“SNA-”). To that extent, there would be some aural similarity between the marks.","60   The Opponent may have initially intended for “SNAC” to be an acronym for “school notification and acknowledgement console”[note: 42], but those words (i.e. “school notification and acknowledgement console”) do not appear in the SNAC Mark. And, even though I have found that “SNAC” would be pronounced as “snac” or “snack”, it does not follow that conceptually one would think of food snacks when looking at the mark. Ultimately, the word “SNAC” is an invented word and therefore has no conceptual meaning. The words “SCHOOL NOTIFICATION & ATTENDANCE APP” in the Application Mark inform that “snaapp” is an app for use in schools, and which provides notification and attendance functions. Thus, the comparison is between “snaapp SCHOOL NOTIFICATION & ATTENDANCE APP” (conceptually: an app for use in schools that provides notification and attendance functions) as compared with “SNAC” (a meaningless term). It is obvious that there is no conceptual similarity between the two.

61   Even if I am wrong in taking into account the meaning accorded to the Application Mark by the words “SCHOOL NOTIFICATION & ATTENDANCE APP” for the purposes of assessing conceptual similarity, the result would still be the same. Under this alternative analysis, the comparison would be between two meaningless invented words which are unaccompanied by any other device marks. In Sarika Connoisseur Café Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA [2013] 1 SLR 531 (“Sarika”), the Court of Appeal found that “NUTELLO” and “NUTELLA” (both textual marks with no accompanying device) to be not conceptually similar because the marks were invented and meaningless terms with no particular idea underlying each of them. According to this line of reasoning, since “SNAC” and “snaapp” are both inherently meaningless, the marks would have no conceptual similarity.

62   And, even if one considers “snaapp” to be conceptually evocative or representative of speed (i.e. in a snap), the concept of speed is still conceptually dissimilar to SNAC which has no meaning.",66 The second step is to compare the goods and services for which registration is sought as against the goods and services for which the earlier trade mark is protected. It is undisputed that the parties’ goods in class 9 and the services in class 38 are identical. The second element in Section 8(2)(b) is therefore satisfied.,"93 Having regard to all of the circumstances, I find that the Opponent’s evidence of alleged actual confusion does not establish that there was likelihood of confusion within the meaning of Section 8(2)(b). The very most that can be said is that, in the parties’ very niche market of mobile apps for use in relation to facilitating communication between schools and parents, there were isolated instances of confusion. But, even then, it is not clear that such confusion was brought about by the similarity between the competing marks and the similarity between the goods and services. In any event, these instances do not show that a substantial portion of the average consumers in that specific market would likely be confused beyond a de minimis level. (It should not be forgotten that the relevant public is the general public of which the niche market would be a small sub-set.) The evidence clearly falls far short of showing that the general public would likely be confused."
32,Intel v Intelsteer,2015,sgipos,OF,3,8,"33 Taking into account all these factors, I am of the view that the Applicants Earlier Class 42 Marks are distinctive, both inherently and through use.",5_5_6_5_7_1,"60     In light of the analysis above, I am of the view that the marks are similar visually to a low extent, somewhat similar aurally while they are only marginally similar conceptually. Therefore, on the whole, I am of the view that the marks are similar to a low degree in totality.","40     In light of the above, I am of the view that the Applicants’ INTEL Word Mark is to a low degree, visually similar to that of the Registered Mark. I draw this conclusion based on an overall visual impression of the marks, bearing in mind, the distinctive and dominant component (this being the word INTEL).

41     The same can be said with regard to the INTEL Stylised Mark. I agree with the Applicants that the stylisation (the circular device) only serves to emphasize the word ""INTEL"" and thus heighten the similarity between the INTEL Stylised Mark and the Registered Mark, the Registered Mark having the word ""INTEL"" ""boxed"" within a rectangle.","47 The next question would then be whether the Applicants’ Earlier Class 42 Marks would be considered to be aurally similar to the Registered Mark? In this regard, I note that the Registered Mark is pronounced as IN-TEL-STEER (i.e. there are 3 syllables) while the INTEL Word Mark and the INTEL Stylised Mark would simply be pronounced as ""IN-TEL"" (i.e. there is only 2 syllables). However, having regard to my opinion (above) that ""INTEL"" is the more dominant component,I am of the view that the INTEL Word Mark and the INTEL Stylised Mark are similar aurally to the Registered Mark to some extent.","56     Following the above analysis, the only other issue left to be dealt with is whether the device and the slogan ""efficiency in electrical energy"" colours, and if so, the extent to which it colours, the concept behind the Registered Mark. I have already alluded above that I am of the view that the device seems to reinforce the slogan ""efficiency in electrical energy"". Taken together, I am of the view that both the device and the slogan will imbue the Registered Mark with the concept of “energy efficiency” to some extent.

57     Being mindful of the principle as propounded by the Court in Staywell above, I am of the view that the Applicants’ Earlier Class 42 Marks (i.e. both the INTEL Word Mark and the INTEL Stylised Mark) are at most, only marginally conceptually similar to the Registered Mark.","65     In relation to the INTEL Word Mark, for example, T9801120E, it would appear that the services (as underlined) are similar. The same can be said of the INTEL Word Mark T0005306J. Applying the factors in British Sugar, the uses, users and nature of the said services can be said to be similar. The services can also be said to be competitive.","100 I am of the view that even if there is some possibility of initial confusion between the Registered Mark and the Applicants’ Earlier Class 42 Marks, as discussed above, in light of (i) the nature of the services which are not cheap; (ii) the fact that they are technical / specialist in nature; and (iii) the purchasing process of the services, any possibility of confusion would be dispelled by the time of purchase."
33,Jamal Abdulnaser v Global Tobacco,2015,Sghc,OS,3,,,6_3_7_6_9_6,"40 I am satisfied that there is similarity between the two marks. Visually, the word “Manchester” dominates, or is at least a significant part of, either mark. The other graphical elements do not detract from the prominence of the word in either mark. Conceptually, both marks allude to whatever may be evoked by the word “Manchester”. Whether that evocation is in terms of tradition or modernity does not matter – the image to be inspired is primarily triggered by the word “Manchester”, and not the surrounding accoutrements. Also, as the Defendant concedes, there was certainly aural similarity. Taking all of these together, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that these marks are similar. While I find similarity in all three aspects, even if I am wrong on conceptual similarity, similarity as a whole would still be made out. Not all three aspects of similarity need to be made out: Hai Tong at [40(a)]. Further, it is recognised that even if only one aspect out of the three is similar, that could be sufficient to establish overall similarity. Thus, even if there is a conceptual difference, the aural and visual similarity taken together would invariably lead to overall similarity between the two marks. It is clear from the cases that what is needed is an appreciation of the holistic impact of the two marks – the inquiries into aural, visual and conceptual similarity do not constitute a mechanical exercise, with each box to be ticked before a conclusion of similarity can be derived. Ultimately, as noted in Staywell at [17], the determination of similarity is a matter of impression. It was noted by the Court of Appeal there that:","32     The Defendant argues that the two marks leave very different impressions to viewers, and thus the common word should not be accepted as the dominant part of each mark. However, it is clear on examination that any person’s eye would be drawn to and would dwell upon the word “Manchester” when looking at each mark individually. This would also be the case when the marks are placed side by side. The other parts of each mark, and the different graphical elements employed are mere accoutrements and minor details. Thus, all in all, it cannot be gainsaid that each mark was visually similar to the other.","40 ... Also, as the Defendant concedes, there was certainly aural similarity.

Ultimately, as noted in Staywell at [17], the determination of similarity is a matter of impression. It was noted by the Court of Appeal there that:","39 In examining conceptual similarity, the aim is to identify the ideas underpinning the mark as a whole; therefore, the analysis must be a holistic one, as each component may have a different conceptual basis: Staywell at [35]. In analysing conceptual similarity, one will need to consider the connotations or evocations inspired by the marks. Certainly, as the Defendant says, one could construe the Plaintiff’s mark as a whole as importing some element of luxury or quality through the use of the coat of arms present on the Plaintiff’s mark. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s mark actually includes the words “House of Quality” and the crest bears the letters “HQ”, which is, presumably, an abbreviation for “House of Quality”. In comparison, the Defendant’s mark would not be taken to directly evoke an association with tradition, luxury or quality. However, in both marks, the word “Manchester” occupies a significant part. Taking each mark as a whole, the conceptual objective is the evocation of whatever it is that the word “Manchester” is supposed to evoke: it may be England or Great Britain, whether it is the Britain of tradition or contemporary English. Different aspects of England or Britain are perhaps evoked by the two marks, but it is ultimately the same object. Alternatively, and I suspect more likely, the image to be evoked is whatever is triggered in the minds of the consumer by the word “Manchester”: the city; England or Great Britain; or the football teams. Indeed, some ambiguity may have been intended behind both these marks. I therefore find that there is conceptual similarity.","41 As noted above, there is no dispute that the goods are identical. Even if the cigarettes are meant to be marketed to different segments of the consumer market, that would not render these goods unidentical or dissimilar.",42 I find that confusion as to the origin of the goods is likely to arise because of the similarity of the marks. A consumer with imperfect recollection is likely to confuse the Defendant’s mark and hence the Defendant’s goods with the Plaintiff’s mark and goods.
34,Fox Racing v Fox Street Wear,2014,Sgipos,OS,3,,,7_7_7_7_7_7,"73 As I have found that the marks are visually, aurally and conceptually similar, it follows that I find them to be similar overall.","66 I agree with the Opponents that the marks are visually similar. The dominant component of both marks is the “fox head” device within the word “FOX”. Furthermore, the overall graphic design and font style used for the textual features are similar, while the “fox head” devices strongly resemble each other.","70 It could be that the proper approach to take would depend on the facts of each individual case. In the current situation, I am of the view that both marks would be pronounced by the average consumer as “FOX”. I therefore find that the marks are aurally similar (and arguably identical, from an aural perspective).","71        The Application Mark and the Opponents’ marks both clearly bring to mind the concept of a fox. It is not necessary to venture further to consider what qualities or ideas are evoked when the average consumer applies this concept to the goods in question, since the same qualities or ideas (whatever they may be) are likely to be evoked.

72        I should add, however, that this aspect of similarity is perhaps less relevant since, as the Applicants point out, the concept of a fox is also used by other traders (namely, [*Image 37 included] by Fox-Wizel Ltd and “FOX” by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) at least in relation to the goods in Class 25 (Applicants’ SD, Exhibit “R-7”).","84 In view of the observations of the High Court in Festina reproduced at [79] and [82] above, and given that the evidence in the present case shows that the Applicants and the Opponents both retail the relevant goods in Class 18 and Class 25 to their customers, I find that the goods in question are similar.","87        In the current case, I find that there is a likelihood of confusion taking into account:

a.   the high degree of similarity of the marks in question ([*Image 39 included] compared with [*Image 40 included]) (see [62]-[73] above);

b.   the likelihood of imperfect recollection of the marks;

c.   the similarity in the respective goods of interest (see [74]-[85] above);

d.   the fact that both parties actually do apply their respective marks to the relevant goods in Classes 18 and 25;

e.   the fact that the goods in question could notionally be sold at a low price (in any event, I note that both parties sell their respective goods at relatively low, or arguably mid-range, prices); and

f.    the probability that consumers will take some care but not an undue degree of care when purchasing the goods in question.

35,Clarins Fragrance v BenQ Materials,2018,Sgipos,OF,1,5,"53   After sieving through the Opponent’s evidence, I do not think that it supports the conclusion that “ANGEL” has acquired greater distinctiveness through use. “ANGEL” does not appear to have been marketed and used without “THIERRY MUGLER”, and it is not clear that consumers necessarily regard “ANGEL” alone as a trade mark (i.e. a guarantee of origin), for the purposes of proving greater distinctiveness through use. (This is the test for acquired distinctiveness: see Nestle at [51].) Consequently, even if evidence of acquired distinctiveness can be taken into account at the marks-similarity stage, “ANGEL” does not enjoy a high threshold before the Application Mark can be considered dissimilar to it.",3_3_3_3_X_X,"78   I have found that the Application Mark and the Opponent’s Mark are, on balance, visually, aurally, and conceptually dissimilar. In totality, the marks are dissimilar.","67   While it is true in certain cases that the overall impression conveyed by a composite trade mark may be dominated by one or more of its components (see Hai Tong at [62(c)], it is important to bear in mind that this need not always be the case. There are many cases where no feature of the mark dominates the mark’s landscape, and to micro-analyse a mark for particular distinctive features in such cases is unhelpful. (Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd v Ceramiche Caesar SpA [2016] 2 SLR 1129 (HC) at [30].[note: 30]) Here, even though “ ” can be said to stand out visually, it does not dominate the Application Mark as a whole. The same can also be said for the elements “derma” and “ ” as well. Each element occupies weight in the whole and I cannot simply focus on any one element to the exclusion of the others.

68   To conclude, when the marks are compared visually, “derma” and “A” would be critical points of distinction that would distinguish the Application Mark visually from the Opponent’s Mark. I thus find the marks to be visually dissimilar.","72   The same result can be reached via the Syllables Approach. Here, the Application Mark would be read as two two-syllable words - “DER-MA AN-GEL” - which is one more word (and two more syllables) than the Opponent’s Mark “AN-GEL”. And just like Ozone, where “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” was found to be aurally dissimilar to “GLAMOUR”, and Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman Limited v Taylors Wines Pty Ltd [2014] SGIPOS 14 where “TAYLORS WAKEFIELD” was found to be aurally dissimilar to “TAYLOR’S”, the conclusion here must be that “DERMA ANGEL” is aurally dissimilar to “ANGEL”.

73   In summary, although both contain the aural component “ANGEL”, the additional first word “DERMA” in the Application Mark sets it apart aurally from the Opponent’s Mark, such that on balance, the marks are aurally dissimilar.","77   To summarise, it was undisputed that the Opponent’s Mark has an ordinary meaning which refers to a heavenly or spiritual, supernatural, being. The Application Mark, on the other hand, has no sensible meaning. I therefore find that the competing marks are conceptually dissimilar.","79   In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step.","79   In light of my finding that the competing marks are more dissimilar than similar, the opposition under Section 8(2)(b) TMA fails at this first step."
36,Kiko v Dooyeon,2016,Sgipos,OF,3,8,"21 The parties had not made specific submissions on this point in the present case. There is no definition of the word “KIKO” in the English dictionary and it can essentially be treated as an invented word. Accordingly, I find that the Opponents’ Mark  enjoys a high degree of inherent distinctiveness in relation to the specification claimed: soaps; perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, hair lotions; dentifrices. Applying Sarika, it would be necessary to demonstrate a greater degree of difference in the Application Mark “in order that it may not be held to be similar” to the Opponents’ Mark.",3_3_5_3_9_3,"57   Earlier on, I have found that the respective marks were not visually nor conceptually similar but as a matter of ""first impression"" may be marginally aurally similar.

However, even with a higher threshold of difference required of the Application Mark “in order that it may not be held to be similar” to the Opponents’ Mark, I am persuaded that "" "" is not visually similar to "" "".","49 Applying the “quantitative assessment of the relative number of syllables which the two marks have in common"" in Sarika, there is no clear answer because both marks have one syllable in common and one syllable not in common. However, as opined by Luxmoore LJ and cited with approval by the House of Lords in Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld [1945] RPC 65, 72, ""the answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another… must nearly always depend on first impression."" When the respective marks here are pronounced, it does appear to me that there is some aural similarity, albeit to a small degree. The first syllable is identical and the respective second syllables rhyme because of a common vowel. I may be slow to find another word with the same first syllable but a different vowel in the second syllable (such as “KICHA”, “KICHI” or “KICHU”) similar to “KIKO”, but where the pronunciations “ki-ko” and “key-cho” are concerned, as a matter of ""first impression"", I am prepared to find that the Application Mark is marginally aurally similar to the Opponents' Mark.","52   I am persuaded by the Applicants' submissions and conclude that there is no conceptual similarity between the Application Mark and the Opponents' Mark. It is trite law that conceptual similarity involves the consideration of the ideas that inform the marks in question. Where the marks are meaningless, they do not evoke any idea to a level of specificity as to possess what can be said to be a concept. Hence, there is no basis for a conceptual comparison of such marks in the first place. Therefore, such marks cannot be said to be conceptually similar.","60   The Opponents submit that the Application Mark is sought to be registered in respect of goods in Class 3 (set out at [1] above) that are identical or similar to the goods for which the Opponents' Mark is registered in the same class (set out at [10] above).

61   The Applicants did not address this in their written submissions nor at the hearing, and understandably so. I am readily persuaded that the respective goods claimed by the marks are similar. They are generally in the nature of cosmetics and hair products in Class 3.

62   Accordingly, I am satisfied that the second element of identity or similarity of goods under Section 8(2)(b) is made out.","81   Taking into account the permissible extraneous factors, I do not find a reasonable likelihood of confusion by the consuming public in Singapore that goods bearing the Application Mark and the Opponents' Mark emanate from the same or economically linked undertakings."

The aurally distinctive component of the Application Mark  is not “DELI” but, “DE-LINTE” as a whole.

38   I am therefore persuaded that there is low to very low aural similarity between these marks.","41   I have found, at [25], that the dominant and distinctive component of the “Deli Tire” mark is indeed “DELI”. However, the geographical concept of “DELI” (if any, as the old name of an Indonesian county) is not present in the Opponents’ “Delium” mark. As described at [25], “Delium” itself is the name of an ancient seaport in Greece. Both concepts of the Opponents’ “Deli Tire” mark and “Delium” mark are in turn very different from the concepts embodied in the Chinese derivation of the Application Mark, as described in the preceding paragraph. Alternatively, apprehending the Application Mark  as filed (i.e. apart from its Chinese derivation), it is an invented word with no meaning and thus is not capable of conceptual comparison with the Opponents’ Marks.

38,Consolidated Artists v THEFACESHOP,2017,Sgipos,OF,1,,,3_3_3_3_8_3,"Conclusion on the similarity of marks

87   It is to be recalled following Staywell at [17] and [18] that:

[17] … The court must ultimately conclude whether the marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar…

[18] … Trade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks-similarity inquiry…

[Emphasis as underlined mine]

88   Further, the average consumer has an “imperfect recollection” and there is a need to consider the general impression that will likely be left by the essential or dominant features of the marks. However, it is also important to remember that the average consumer is one who would exercise some care and a measure of good sense in making his or her purchases, not that of an unthinking person in a hurry.

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1

89   I am of the view that the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1 in comparison to the Application Mark is visually and aurally more dissimilar than similar and conceptually different.

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2

90   With regard to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2, it is even more dissimilar (in terms of degree) to the Application Mark in comparison to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1 in all aspects. Thus, it is visually and aurally dissimilar and conceptually distinct in contrast to the Application Mark.

91   In light of the above, this ground of opposition (section 8(2)(b)) fails at the first stage of the 3-stage analysis. However, for completeness, I shall proceed to the other stages.","Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1

[...]

61   Overall, I am of the view that the Application Mark and the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1 are visually more dissimilar than similar.

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1

[...]

68   Having regard to all of the above, the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2 is visually more dissimilar than similar (and more so than the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1) when compared to the Application Mark.

Conclusion

69   I come to the conclusion that the Opponents’ Earlier Marks are both visually more dissimilar than similar in comparison to the Application Mark.","Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1

73   For the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1, the only dominant component (if any) can be “Mango”, although the level of distinctiveness is not high having regard to the goods of interest in the current case[note: 23].

74   On the other hand, with regard to the Application Mark, I am of the view that “THEFACESHOP”, which is a particularly long word with no spaces in between the words “THE”, “FACE” and “SHOP” is allusive and can be regarded as distinctive of the relevant goods such that it is the distinctive and dominant component of the Application Mark rather than “Mango” and “Seed”. In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the fact that the word “THEFACESHOP” is at the bottom of the “three-tiered” Application Mark.

75   Having regard to the above, applying the Dominant Component Approach, the marks (“MANGO” vs “THEFACESHOP”) are clearly aurally dissimilar.

76   Applying the Quantitative Assessment Approach, the Application Mark consists of six syllables, of which only two of the six syllables are common to that of the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1 ([19] of AWS). The irresistible conclusion is that using this approach, the marks are also aurally more dissimilar than similar.

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2

77   Again, applying the Dominant Component Approach, I am of the view that the marks are aurally dissimilar (see above in relation to the visual aspect).

78   Applying the Quantitative Assessment Approach, the word “adorably” further differentiates the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2 from the Application Mark. While the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2 also consists of six syllables, again only two of the six syllables are common with the Application Mark such that the marks are aurally more dissimilar than similar.

Conclusion

79   In light of the above, regardless of the approach being applied, both the Opponents’ Earlier Marks are aurally more dissimilar than similar in comparison to the Application Mark.","Conceptual Similarity

82   The Court of Appeal in Staywell expounded at [35] as follows:

[35] …Unlike the aural analysis, which involves the utterance of the syllables without exploring the composite meaning embodied by the words, the conceptual analysis seeks to uncover the ideas that lie behind and inform the understanding of the mark as a whole…Greater care is therefore needed in considering what the conceptually dominant component of a composite mark is, because the idea connoted by each component might be very different from the sum of its parts…

[Emphasis as underlined mine]

83   Caesarstone CA has also clarified that the design of a mark only affects the visual but not the conceptual aspect of the analysis (see [23] of AWS).

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1

84   It is obvious that the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1 simply conveys the idea of a mango fruit. On the other hand, the Application Mark conveys the idea of the seed of a mango fruit, as well as the idea of a shop that sells facial products ([22] of AWS).

85   Thus, conceptually, they are dissimilar.

Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2

86   The Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2 conveys the idea of a mango fruit, and the idea of being lovable or endearing ([22] of AWS). Taken as a whole, I am of the view that the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2 can be considered to be even more conceptually dissimilar to the Application Mark in comparison to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1.","96   I am of the view that the goods as italicised and emboldened in [93] above are identical while the rest of the goods sought to be registered for the Application Mark can be said to be similar to those italicised and emboldened in [93] for the Opponents’ Earlier Marks. For example, body cleansers can be regarded to be similar to soap.

97   In light of the above, it is quite clear that this element has been satisfied and there is no need to dwell in detail on the similarity of the rest of the goods in Class 3.","124   With regard to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1, I have concluded above that in terms of the factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity on consumer perception, the overall impression left by the marks is that they are more dissimilar than similar. In relation to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 2, I have concluded above that the marks are even more dissimilar to the Application Mark (in comparison to the Opponents’ Earlier Mark 1) in all aspects.

125   With regard to goods-similarity, having regard to the price (mid-range), the nature of the products (personal, self-care products) and the mode of sale (self-service items with some level of assistance by specialists), I am of the view that all these factors, taken together, point away from a likelihood of confusion.

126   Taking all of the above into consideration, I am of the view that this element has not been made out, whether it be confusion as to origin or confusion as to being economically linked"
