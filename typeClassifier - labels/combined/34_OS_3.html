In response, the Applicants filed a Statutory Declaration of Rajinder Singh, the Managing Director of the Applicants, on 2 February 2012 (“<b>Applicants’ SD</b>”). The Opponents then filed another two Statutory Declarations in reply. The first was that of Peter Fox, the President and CEO of the Opponents, dated 6 December 2012 (“<b>Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</b>”) and the second was a Supplementary Statutory Declaration of Geoff Fox dated 2 December 2013 (“<b>Opponents’ SSD</b>”).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 April 2014, the parties exchanged their written submissions (referred to hereafter as the“<b>Applicants’ Written Submissions</b>” and the “<b>Opponents’ Written Submissions</b>” as the case may be). The opposition was heard before me on 29 April 2014 and 17 June 2014. On 10 June 2014, the Applicants requested for security for costs from the Opponents in the sum of S$50,000. On the day of the hearing on 17 June 2014, parties informed me that they had reached an agreement for the Opponents to furnish security in the sum of S$30,000.

Fox Clothing Company had allegedly informed the Applicants that they had used this mark in the 1980s, but that records have been destroyed through the passage of time; Fox Clothing Company is also no longer available as the business was terminated in 1995 (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [19]). This mark is now registered in the Applicants’ name by virtue of two assignments. The first assignment took place on 9 January 1998, pursuant to which the mark was transferred from Fox Clothing Company to Rajinder Singh trading as Guilford Enterprises. The second assignment, which took place on 2 August 1999, transferred the mark from Guilford Enterprises to the Applicants. Rajinder Singh is the Managing Director of the Applicants. With regard to these assignments, it should be noted that the Applicants had initially claimed to have acquired the mark directly from Fox Clothing Company. Further, the Applicants’ SD in this regard was truncated and stated that this mark was “acquired from its previous owners, Fox Clothing Company of [blank]” (sentence incomplete) (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [3]). This matter, which was picked up by the Opponents as evidence of bad faith on the part of the Applicants, is discussed at [48(2)] below.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Class 18, the Applicants’ Fox Head Device<strong>, [*Image 7</strong> <strong>included]</strong>, was registered by Rajinder Singh trading as Guilford Enterprises on 7 January 1998 (under registration no. T98/00173J). This was two days before the assignment of the Applicants’ Fox Head Device in Class 25 (T81/03475D) from Fox Clothing Company to Rajinder Singh trading as Guilford Enterprises.&nbsp; The Applicants’ Fox Head Device (T98/00173J) registered in Class 18 was similarly assigned to the Applicants on 2 August 1999.</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr Rajinder Singh, the Managing Director of the Applicants, “Fox” was selected as the Applicants’ company name as he wanted to develop a new line of clothing and accessories utilising the Applicants’ Fox Head Device acquired from Rajinder Singh trading as Guilford Enterprises. Further, it was explained that the Application Mark, which was allegedly first used in 1999, is an extension of the concept of the Applicants’ Fox Tail Device with Slogan, <strong>[*Image 8</strong> <strong>included]</strong>. The Applicants alleged that their idea was to incorporate the Applicants’ Fox Head Device (instead of the device of a fox tail) in the letter “O” in the word “Fox”. The Fox Tail Device with Slogan was modernised by removing the oval device and substituting it with a banner depicting the words “What’s Stopping You?” According to the Applicants, the concept was to use the Application Mark in the front of the apparel, for example, a T-shirt, and the Applicants’ Fox Tail Device at the back of the T-shirt (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [6]).</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants further explained that there was already a market for Fox Clothing Company’s goods when the first assignment (see [12] above) took place in 1998. At about this time, Mr Rajinder Singh said that he was aware of the Opponents’ products which had just entered the market and offered speciality clothing and accessories for motor cross sports and cycling, under the “Moto-X-Fox” mark and later “<strong>[*Image 9</strong> <strong>included]</strong>.”. The Applicants asserted that they took extra pains to incorporate “distinguishing features” in their mark so that the Applicants could develop their own market which they claimed to have done since 2000 (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [34], pg 19 in response to the Opponents’ allegation of bad faith).</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants claim to distribute their Class 18 goods through over 20 departmental stores and other retail outlets located throughout the island.

Within two years, the Opponents were manufacturing high-performance suspension and engine components for racers looking for an on-track advantage. In 1977, the Founder of the Opponents, Geoff Fox created his own privately-owned professional motocross team, Team Moto-X Fox, which competed in various competitions. Through the competitions, the outfits worn by the Team Moto-X Fox riders gained popularity among the fans and interested enthusiasts who inquired about their availability.

some detail since the Opponents relied on it to support their allegation of bad faith against the Applicants. The relevant report in the Investigator’s SD dated 19 August 2004 was made by Mr Tan Chin Chuan of Commercial Investigations LLP. The purpose of the report was to ascertain: (1) information on how the Applicants derived their trade marks; (2) information on the owner’s background, i.e., whether he had past connections with the Opponents; and (3) prejudicial statements or admissions of the Applicants or their owner.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report, investigations were conducted over a three-day period from 16 to 18 August 2004. The persons conducting the investigations were not disclosed, but were collectively referred to as “operatives”. The salient facts of the report are recounted below.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16 August 2004, the operatives visited the Applicants’ premises at 49 Tannery Lane at about 1pm. The premises had signages depicting “FOX”, “GILFORD” and “LUMBERJACKS” (among others). They were informed by one female Indian staff known as Shanti that the sales manager was out of town. Shanti also did not have knowledge of the Opponents’ “Fox” trade marks (depicted at [22] and [24] above). Another female Indian staff known as Geetha then arrived and attended to the operatives. Geetha said that the sales manager was outstation and there were no suitable personnel whom the operatives could speak to. Geetha had some knowledge of the Opponents’ “Fox” marks and informed the operatives that the “Fox Street Wear” products owned by her company were different from the Opponents. She revealed that the Applicants also have a shop at 3 Coleman Street, #B1-01/02 Peninsula Shopping Centre which was owned by the Applicants and managed by the same management.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18 August 2004 at about 1pm, the operatives visited the shop at #B1-01/02 Peninsula Shopping Centre. The outlet had a signage depicting “LUMBERJACKS APPAREL PTE LTD” and was staffed by a female Indian known as Pathma and a male Indian who appeared to be in his late 20s. Goods from both the Applicants and Opponents were seen at the outlet. In particular, there were four mannequins on top of a display shelf donning the Opponents’ “Fox Racing” jerseys. When questioned, Pathma did not know how the Applicants’ brand was derived and whether the Applicants were previously or presently connected with the Opponents. However, she was aware that “Fox Racing” is an American brand and the apparel was brought in from Malaysia without any packaging. The operatives then proceeded to purchase one of the Opponents’ T-shirts at $30.00 which was packed in the Applicants’ plastic bag. It was observed that the Nets transaction slip was issued under the name of Gilford Enterprises rather than Lumberjacks and when asked, Pathma revealed that both companies belong to the same boss.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The version of events that happened on 18 August 2004 is disputed. The Applicants sought to clarify that the Opponents’ products that were found in the outlet were genuine parallel-imported products from a third party in Malaysia. The Applicants explained that the products had no packaging because the products were sold as stock lots by the manufacturer to a third party.The Applicants insist that Pathma packed the Opponents’ shirt into the Applicants’ plastic bag at the insistence of the operatives. Further, the Applicants allege that Pathma went to great lengths to explain the differences between the two marks and that the plastic bag was a plastic bag of the Applicants. There was no attempt to deceive nor was the investigator deceived.

These include the following:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Application Mark, the Applicants are also using other marks (see [10] above) which are even more similar, if not identical, to the marks which the Opponents are using (see [22] above). In particular, the Applicants are using the device of a fox head <strong>[*Image 15</strong> <strong>included]</strong>, which is practically identical to the device of a fox head <strong>[*Image 16</strong> <strong>included]</strong> which the Opponents are using. The Applicants’ Fox Head Device has been registered in Singapore on 11 August 1981 in Class 25 (see [10] above). The Opponents’ fox head device has apparently been used in the US on Class 25 goods since 14 February 1976, but has not been used in Singapore (see [22] above).</font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants’ Fox Head Device was originally registered by a business known as Fox Clothing Company; this business is no longer in existence (see [12] above).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the fox head device incorporated in the Application Mark is in fact a reproduction of the Applicants’ fox head device.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Opponents do not appear to use the above device of a fox head <strong>[*Image 17</strong> <strong>included]</strong>, in Singapore, they do use two other very similar fox head devices <strong>[*Image 18</strong> <strong>included]</strong>, both of which are registered in Singapore in 2004 for Class 9 goods (see [22] and [24] above).</font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents’ mark, which is arguably most similar to the Application Mark (namely, T01/17910F <strong>[*Image 19</strong> <strong>included]</strong> in Class 25), secured registration in Singapore by relying on honest concurrent use with the Applicants’ prior registrations of <strong>[*Image 20</strong> <strong>included]</strong> (see [10] and [25] above and [55] below).</font></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently no proceedings in Singapore by the Opponents against the Applicants’ prior registrations of <strong>[*Image 21</strong> <strong>included]</strong>, or by the Applicants against the Opponents’ prior registrations of <strong>[*Image 22</strong> <strong>included]</strong></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Some of the above information is depicted below in chronological order:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><strong>[*Image 23 included]</strong></font></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Main Decision</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Ground of Opposition under Section 7(6)</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(6) of the Act reads:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><b><span lang="EN-GB">7.—</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the main ground of opposition advanced by the Opponents.

The dispute between the parties concerned the application of these principles to the facts of the present case. In my view, the main issue in this case is what approach should be taken when the facts are heavily disputed, and there has been no cross-examination of any witnesses on their evidence.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, it would be helpful to briefly set out the applicable principles of law which have been helpfully summarised in the Court of Appeal decision in <b><i>Valentino Globe BV v Pacific Rim Industries Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 2 SLR 1203.xml&#39;)">[2010] 2 SLR 1203</a></nobr></b> (“<b><i>Valentino</i></b>”).

Clearly when considering the question of whether an application to register is made in bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to apply for registration would be regarded as [being] in bad faith by persons adopting proper standards.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This test, which was referred to by Sir Aldous (<i>id</i> at [25]) as the ‘combined’ test of bad faith, contains both a subjective element (<i>viz</i>, what the particular applicant knows) and an objective element (<i>viz</i>, what ordinary persons adopting proper standards would think).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, this combined test of bad faith was succinctly explained in <i>Ajit Weekly Trade Mark</i> <nobr>[2006] RPC 25</nobr> as follows (at [35] and [41]):</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… Bad faith is to be judged according to the combined test of dishonesty for accessory liability [for] breach of trust set out by the majority of the House of Lords in <i>Twinsetcra Ltd v Yardley</i> [2002] 2 A.V. 164, with <i>Gromax Plasticulture</i> [([103] <i>supra</i>)] … providing the appropriate standard namely, acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced persons in the particular commercial area being examined.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">…</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;… [T]he upshot of the Privy [Council’s] decision in [<i>Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/English/22734-E-M.xml&#39;)">[2006] 1 WLR 1476</a>] is: (a) to confirm the House of Lords’ test for dishonesty applied in <i>Twinsectra</i>, i.e. the combined test; and (b) to resolve any ambiguity in the majority of their Lordships’ statement of that test by making it clear that an enquiry into a defendant’s views as regards the normal standards of honesty is not part of the test. The subjective element of the test means that the tribunal must ascertain what the defendant knew about the transaction or other matter in question.

Conversely, where it can be shown that the applicant knew of an <i>exclusive</i> proprietary right of <i>another</i> in relation to the trade mark it seems to furtively register, then any such registration would, almost invariably, quite clearly fall short of the relevant standards.

In the Opponents’ first round of evidence, this was taken as clear evidence that the Applicants were deliberately trying to confuse or deceive the public (<b>Opponents’ 1<sup>st</sup> SD</b> at [42]). In response, the Applicants flatly rejected this evidence. Instead, the Applicants asserted that the Opponents’ shirt was packed into the Applicants’ plastic bag at the insistence of the investigators. Further, the Applicants allege that the retail assistant went to great lengths to explain the differences between the two marks and that the plastic bag was a plastic bag of the Applicants (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [34], pg 20 in response to the Opponents’ investigations). In reply, the Opponents strongly rejected the Applicants’assertions and point out, among other things, that “<i>the said staff clearly did not have to be forced to pack the product into such packaging, since this was done as a matter of course</i>”(<b>Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</b> at pg 24(d)). At the hearing on 17 June 2014, Counsel for the Applicants rejected the Opponents’ insinuations and highlighted that one of the objectives of the investigations was to obtain prejudicial statements or admissions from the Applicants.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment of Applicants’ Fox Head Device, <strong>[*Image 28</strong> <strong>included]</strong> (T81/03475D) – When the Applicants filed their evidence, they asserted that this mark was <i>“acquired from its previous owners, Fox Clothing Company of [blank]”</i> (sentence incomplete), and that this registration was transferred to the Applicants on 9 January 1998 (<b>Applicants’ SD</b> at [3] and [17]). The Opponents pounced on this evidence in their reply arguing that “<i>[t]his sudden emergence of a purported other entity‘Fox Clothing Company’… at this advanced stage of proceedings is both startling and wholly unsubstantiated”</i>(<b>Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</b> at [4]). The Opponents further pointed out that the purported assignment to the Applicants could not have taken place on 9 January 1998 as the Applicants were only incorporated a year later on 8 January 1999 (<b>Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</b> at [17]). However, at the hearing on 29 April 2014, Counsel for the Applicants produced assignment documents recorded with the Trade Marks Registry showing that this mark was originally registered on 11 August 1981 in the name of Mohd Tafel bin Elamdin trading as Fox Clothing Company, assigned to Rajinder Singh trading as Guilford Enterprises on 9 January 1998, then assigned again on 2 August 1999 to the Applicants.

In contrast, the first registrations by the Opponents for marks incorporating a similar fox head device <strong>[*Image 30</strong> <strong>included]</strong> were only obtained in 2001. It could therefore be argued that the Applicants had, in the words of the High Court in <b><i>Warman</i></b>, the right to register the Application Mark.</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it appears that the Opponents have been using a very similar (and arguably identical) fox head device <strong>[*Image 31</strong> <strong>included]</strong> since 1974, there is no evidence that Mohd Tafel bin Elamdin trading as Fox Clothing Company copied this device. Even if he did, there is no evidence that the Applicants knew or should have known about this, particularly given that this mark had already been on the Register for 18 years before the Applicants acquired it.

Specifically, the Opponents overcame objections from the Trade Marks Registry by <i>“show[ing] to the satisfaction of the Registrar that there has been honest concurrent use in the course of trade in Singapore of the [Opponents’] trade mark”</i> pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Act.</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue was raised in the Applicants’ SD (at [25]) and during the hearing on 17 June 2014, but not in the Applicants’ Written Submissions. Essentially, the Applicants argue that, just as the Opponents’ <strong>[*Image 35</strong> <strong>included]</strong> mark (T01/17910F) in Class 25 was permitted to proceed to registration, the Application Mark should similarly be permitted registration. In the Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD (at [23]-[25]), the Opponents argue that the registration of this mark through honest concurrent use is irrelevant to the current opposition proceedings, and that in any event, the current opposition proceedings are directed at a different mark, namely, the Application Mark, which should be considered as a composite whole and not dissected into its constituent elements. This issue is also not addressed in the Opponents’ Written Submissions, and at the hearing, the Opponents basically reiterated their position as set out in the Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD.</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in <b>Susanna H.S. Leong, <i>Intellectual Property Law of Singapore</i> (Academy Publishing, 2013)</b> (“<b><i>Susanna Leong</i></b>”) (see [28.420]-[28.433] generally), honest concurrent use <i>“provides a limited exception to the objection that registration of a trade mark should be refused as there is a conflict of marks under the relative grounds”</i> (at [28.420]). In Professor Leong’s view, <i>“once the applicant successfully proves honest concurrent use, the registrar cannot refuse registration by looking at other discretionary matters”</i> (such as whether there will be any confusion to the public). The onus is on the proprietor of the earlier mark to commence opposition proceedings, and if the proprietor does so, <i>“the registrar does not have the discretion to permit registration even though honest concurrent use has been established”</i> (see [28.427]-[28.433]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does appear ironic that the Application Mark could be blocked by a mark of the Opponents, which could itself have been blocked by some of the Applicants’ own prior marks. However, there is nothing in the wording of Section 8(2) of the Act which suggests that an opponent may not, in opposition proceedings, rely on an earlier trade mark which secured registration on the basis of honest concurrent use with other trade marks owned by the applicants.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that what the Applicants should have done is to apply to invalidate the Opponents’ mark under Section 23 of the Act, which they are expressly permitted to do under Section 9(2)(b) of the Act (but see also Section 24 of the Act (Effect of acquiescence)). Additionally, the Applicants could perhaps rely on some doctrine of acquiescence or estoppel. However, in the absence of any submissions to this effect by the Applicants, and bearing in mind the adversarial nature of opposition proceedings, I am unable to hold that the Opponents are prevented from relying on their <strong>[*Image 36</strong> <strong>included]</strong> mark (T01/17910F) in Class 25 in support of an opposition under Section 8(2) of the Act.</font></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Test under Section 8(2) of the Act</font></strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the Opponents’ submission that the acid-test for determining if registration should be disallowed under Section 8(2) of the Act is the test set out in <b><i>Sabel BV v Puma AG</i> <nobr>[1998] RFC 199</nobr></b> (“<b><i>Sabel</i></b>”), the law in Singapore on the applicable test for determining whether a mark is likely to cause confusion with an earlier mark is that of the step-by-step approach as most recently enunciated by the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span> Hospitality Group&nbsp;Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/15751-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] 1 SLR 911</a></nobr></b> (“<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>”).

Further, it is well-established in Singapore law that there is no requirement that all three aspects of similarity must be made out before the marks can be found to be similar (<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [18]; <b><i>MediaCorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc</i> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 496</b> at [32]; <b><i>Sarika Connoisseur Café Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr></b> (“<b><i>Sarika</i></b>”) at [16]). Instead, the three aspects of similarity <i>“are signposts towards answering the question of whether the marks are similar…[and] [t]rade-offs can occur between the three aspects of similarity in the marks similarity inquiry”</i> (<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [18]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> rejected the idea that the marks similarity requirement is a <i>“low threshold test”</i> not only because the low threshold or minimum threshold requirement is not supported in law, but also because it is <i>“inconsistent with the reality that the similarity of marks is ultimately and inevitably a matter of impression rather than one that can be resolved as a quantitative or mechanistic exercise”</i> (<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [17]). Further, the court held that the low or minimum threshold approach would be unfaithful to the step-by-step approach mandated by the Act as it <i>“would backload much of the court’s assessment to the confusion inquiry stage”</i> (<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [19]).Ultimately, an assessment of similarity <i>“must be based on the overall impression given by the marks, bearing in mind, in particular, their distinctive and dominant components”</i>(<b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> at [26] citing <b><i>Sabel</i></b> at pg 224).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the Court of Appeal in <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b> (at [20]), marks similarity requires a mark-for-mark assessment without consideration of external matters. The consideration of external matters are reserved for the confusion stage as that is when the court is required to assess the effect of the objective similarity of the marks on consumer perception. This approach was also held to be conceptually clearer as it recognises that the issue of resemblance between the competing marks is distinct from the question of the effect of such resemblance. As Menon CJ observed:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><b><span lang="EN-GB">“</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on this issue, we reiterate that the assessment of marks similarity is mark-for-mark without consideration of any external matter: see <i>Mediacorp</i> at [33], <i>Sarika</i> at [17] and <i>Hai Tong</i> at [40(b)]. This means that <i>at the marks similarity stage</i> this even extends to not considering the relative weight and importance of each aspect of similarity having regard to the goods. This does not mean that the court ignores the reality that the relative weight and importance of each aspect of similarity might vary from case to case and will in fact depend on all the circumstances including the nature of the goods and the type of marks, as we observed at [40(b)] of <i>Hai Tong</i>. Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the <i>confusion</i> stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon to assess the <i>effect</i> of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers. We recognise that this reflects a slight departure from the approach taken by the High Court in <i>Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co Ltd</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0552.xml&#39;)">[2010] 4 SLR 552</a></nobr> at [55]-[56], and by this court in <i>Sarika</i> at [38]. We think that this is conceptually clearer because it recognises that the issue of <i>resemblance</i> between the competing marks is distinct from the question of the <i>effect</i> of such resemblance. A practical application of this approach can be found in European jurisprudence: see <i>Mystery Drinks GmbH v OHIM</i> (T 99/01) [2004] ETMR (18) 217 and <i>Phillips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM</i> <nobr>[2003] ETMR 60</nobr>. In these cases the court considered, respectively, the particular significance of aural similarity in relation to beverages normally sold by oral order, and visual similarity in relation to clothing normally sold based on the consumer’s direct perception, both for the specific purpose of determining whether consumer confusion was likely to arise.<b>”</b></span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before analysing whether the marks in the present case are similar, I also note that it is trite law that this inquiry should be undertaken from the perspective of the average consumer, and it is assumed that the average consumer has “imperfect recollection”, such that the contesting marks are not compared side by side and examined in detail for the sake of isolating particular points of difference: see, amongst others, the Court of Appeal decision in <b><i>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal&nbsp;</i></b> <b><nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14932-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 2 SLR 941</a></nobr></b> (“<b><i>Hai Tong</i></b>”) at [40].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Visual Similarity</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Opponents that the marks are visually similar.

In fairness to the judge, it should be noted that she specifically considered that the “St.” and “Park” portions of the competing marks, though not as dominant as the “Regis” portion, were not to be ignored… In relation to both the competing marks “Regis” is the element that is distinctive in the non-technical sense because it is what will stand out in the imperfect recollection of the consumer.

Yet, interestingly, even in cases involving goods which presumably are not familiar to the layperson, such as goods in Class 12 (automobile apparatus and equipment, automobile mechanisms, engines automobile bodies, sections, devices including safety and anti-theft devices, automobile componentry segments, parts fittings and accessories for automobiles) and Class 4 (fuels and lubricants), no evidence of uses, users or trade channels was considered when the Principal Assistant Registrar and the High Court judge assessed goods-similarity in <b><i>Mobil Petroleum v Hyundai Mobis</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0427.xml&#39;)">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 427</a></b> at [25]; <b><i>Hyundai Mobis v Mobil Petroleum</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/Decision/55337-M.xml&#39;)">[2007] SGIPOS 12</a></nobr></b> at [44]-[48]).

The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties' products.

However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has a power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.<b>”</b></span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not in dispute that the relevant date at which goodwill is to be assessed is the application date of the Application Mark (i.e. 30 March 2005).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a preliminary point, I note the Applicants’ argument that the Opponents have “<i>no goodwill in Singapore for goods in Class 18</i>.” I also note that the Applicants accept that the Opponents have sold goods in other classes (i.e clothing in Class 25, bike and motor cycle accessories in Class 9 and stickers in Class 16) bearing the relevant marks. (<b>Applicants’ Written Submissions</b> at [10.9] &amp; [10.6], and also [10.3]-[10.8] generally.) The Opponents did not address this argument in their written or oral submissions.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuitively, it does not seem appropriate to segment the goodwill in a business into different categories according to the classes of goods for which a trade mark can be registered. This also appears to be inconsistent with the position that “<i>[</i><i>t]here is no rule that the defendant must operate in the same field of activity as the claimant</i>”: see <b><i>Kerly</i></b><b><i>’s</i></b> at [18-106]. Instead, it appears that any alleged different fields of activity should be addressed when we consider the second element of misrepresentation.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the facts of the case (as discussed in the next paragraph), it is not necessary for me to address this argument. It is also not appropriate to express any view on this issue in the absence of submissions by the parties.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the Opponents have conducted their business in Singapore since 1996. In the five years preceding the application date, their annual sales have ranged from $186,527.32 (in 2001) to $383,606.12 (in 2003) (see [27] above). The Opponents have not provided a breakdown as to how much of these sales are in relation to goods in Class 18. However, I have no doubt that the sales did include Class 18 goods such as bags, wallets and belts since, among other things, their product catalogues depict these goods and sample invoices reflect the sales of these goods (see, for example, <b>Opponents’ 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</b> at pg 43, 46, 49-50, 53, 56, 59, 62-63, 68, 74-76, 79-80, 84, 88-89, etc).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I find that the Opponents enjoy goodwill in Singapore as at 30 March 2005.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Misrepresentation</font></strong></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier found that there is a likelihood of confusion under Section 8(2)(b) of the Act between the Application Mark and the Opponents’<strong>[*Image 41</strong> <strong>included]</strong> mark in Class 25 (see [62]-[87] above). It does not follow that there will consequently also always be misrepresentation in such circumstances.</font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong</i></b> (at [109]-[110]) has clarified the differences between the tort of passing off and a claim for trade mark infringement. The Court of Appeal stated at [110]:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><b><span lang="EN-GB">“</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">Moreover, even <b>in relation to the element of misrepresentation</b>, it has been observed in <i>Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0904.xml&#39;)">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 904</a> (“<i>Kellogg</i>”) that at least in relation to the corresponding provision of the 1992 TMA, <b>the test in the tort of passing off is probably a more demanding one than the corresponding inquiry in a trade mark infringement action</b> (see <i>Kellogg</i> at [32]). <b>In the former, it is necessary to show that the defendant’s actions amount to a misrepresentation that is likely to deceive the relevant segment of the public</b>, whereas in a trade mark infringement action, the question is whether, because of the similarities between the registered mark and the allegedly infringing mark and between the goods or services on which these marks are applied, there is likely to be confusion. Moreover, as observed in <i>Polo (HC)</i> ([79] <i>supra</i>) at [23] and endorsed by this court in <i>Polo (CA)</i> ([16] <i>supra</i>) at [33], <b>in an action in passing off, the likelihood of deception is to be assessed having regard to all the circumstances</b>, whereas in a trade mark infringement action under s 27(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Act, the likelihood of confusion must stem from the similarity between the contesting marks and the similarity between the goods or services to which they are applied. Lastly, whereas passing off is concerned with protecting the plaintiff’s goodwill in his business, the action for infringement is geared towards protecting the trade mark owner’s proprietary rights in respect of his trade mark…<b>”</b></span></font></p> <p class="Judg-ReportedBy"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(emphasis added)</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, a couple of factors in the Opponents’ favour is that they have actually used the relevant marks on Class 18 goods, and that both parties retail the same type of goods in Classes 18 and 25 (see [83] and [84] above).

Further, the Applicants strenuously dispute the Opponents’ claims. The Applicants’ submit that the Opponents have not proven that copyright subsists in the works in question and highlight that there is no evidence on authorship, date of creation and place of publication (<b>Applicants’ Written Submissions</b> at [13.4]).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Singapore law, there is no mechanism to “register” copyright. The Opponents have not adduced any evidence as to the effect or implications of the New Zealand Customs Service accepting a copyright notice or of copyright registration in Canada. For example, is the purpose of a copyright notice in these countries to establish subsistence of copyright and/or ownership of copyright? Is it to give notice to the public of the existence of a claim to copyright? Is registration a pre-condition to commencing a claim for copyright infringement and/or to claim damages for infringement? Do the relevant authorities carry out any form of examination to verify an applicant’s claims or are such claims accepted at face value? What is the evidential effect of such certificates? In the absence of evidence addressing any of these questions, I am not prepared to accept the Opponents’ copyright claim simply based on the documents adduced.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for one of the Canadian certificates, there is no depiction of the artistic work for which the copyright certificate is granted. (I also note that both the Canadian copyright certificates reflect the copyright owner as “Fox Head, Inc”. In the current opposition proceedings, the Opponents have not explained their relationship with Fox Head, Inc. However, for some of the Opponents’ trade mark registrations, documents filed with the Singapore Trade Marks Registry indicate that this is just a change of name.)</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly, the New Zealand document is undated, while the Canadian documents reflect the dates of first publication of the works in question <strong>[*Image 48</strong> <strong>included]</strong> as 19 April 2006 and 30 September 1994 respectively. Both these dates are after the registration of the <strong>[*Image 49</strong> <strong>included]</strong> mark by Fox Clothing Company on 11 August 1981; this mark was ultimately assigned to the Applicants (see [12] above). The device of a fox head in the Application Mark <strong>[*Image 50</strong> <strong>included]</strong> clearly resembles this mark, which is owned by the Applicants, more closely that the later copyright works which the Opponents rely on in support of this ground of opposition. I note that the Opponents also claim to have used an identical/almost identical <strong>[*Image 51</strong> <strong>included]</strong> mark since 14 February 1976 (see [22], item 2 above).
