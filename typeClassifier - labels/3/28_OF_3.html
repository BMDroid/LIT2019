jurisprudence as the relevant test under Section 8(2)(b).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal, in the recent decision of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span> Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc and another and another appeal</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/15751-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2014] 1 SLR 911</a></nobr>

lang="EN-GB">... It is clear from the plain words of ss&nbsp;8 as well as 27 of the Act that the only relevant type of confusion for the purpose of grounding an opposition or an infringement action, is that which is</span>&nbsp;<em><span lang="EN-GB">brought about by</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">the similarity between the competing marks and between the goods and services in relation to which the marks are used. Since this court’s decision in</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, our courts have given effect to this statutory wording by applying what is now known as the “step-by-step” approach, as opposed to the competing “global appreciation approach” applied in Europe after</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1998] RPC 199</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”). Under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. The first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round. Under the global appreciation approach the elements of similarity between marks and goods or services, whilst still necessary ingredients in the confusion inquiry, are elided with other factors going towards the ultimate question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Sabel v Puma</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB">at 223–224, and</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc</span></em> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[1999] RPC 117</nobr> (“</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Canon</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">”) at 132). Whilst there have been suggestions that the two approaches might be distinct without being different, we maintain this dichotomy and endorse the step-by-step approach as being conceptually neater and more systematic and, importantly, as being more aligned with the requirements imposed under our statute (see</span> <em><span lang="EN-GB">Polo (CA)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">) at [8]).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed under Section 8(2)(b), the Opponents have to prove three elements, namely that the marks are similar; the goods are identical or similar; and, because of the foregoing, there is</span>&nbsp;a likelihood of confusion&nbsp;on the part of the public.<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; I</span> turn now to each element in turn.</font></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">Similarity of Marks: Principles</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte Ltd</i> <i>v Ferrero SpA</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14554-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 1 SLR 531</a></nobr> ("<b><i>Sarika</i></b>") at [16] (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</i></b> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/14932-SSP-M.xml&#39;)">[2013] 2 SLR 941</a></nobr> ("<b><i>Hai Tong</i></b>") at [39]) held that:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">The decided cases have established that the court will consider three aspects of similarity, <i>viz</i>, visual, aural and conceptual similarity: <i>Polo (CA)</i> at [24]; <i>Mobil Petroleum Co., Inc v Hyundai Mobis</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr> at [17].&nbsp; However, it is not a pre-requisite that all three aspects of similarity must be made out before there can be a finding of similarity between the sign and the mark: <i>Mediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc</i> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0496.xml&#39;)">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496</a> at [32] ("<i>Mediacorp</i>").

Simply put, a trade-off between the three aspects of similarity can be made, and each case ought to be viewed in its own context: <i>Ozone Community Corp v Advance Magazine Publishers Inc</i> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0382.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 382</a></nobr> ("<i>Ozone Community</i>") at [40].

In contrast, the Opponents' SMARTIES marks have no punctuation.&nbsp; The Applicants argue that the visual impact of punctuation marks should not be discounted. The average English-reading consumer is accustomed to noticing punctuation marks in his ordinary visual appreciation of words. The apostrophe, in particular, marks the difference between a plural noun and a possessive noun (e.g. DOGS / DOG’S). &nbsp; As the average consumer would surely notice the apostrophe when looking at the Application Mark as a whole, this punctuation mark provides a visually perceptible difference from the word “SMARTIES”.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Applicants sought to distinguish the Application Mark from the Opponents' four stylised SMARTIES Marks (Trade Mark Nos. T9803132Z, T0808179I, T0420818B and T0420819J) in thick bubble font with rounded edges. Trade Mark Nos. T9803132Z, T0808179I depict the word “SMARTIES” against a blue rectangular background, surrounded by many colourful oval devices representing “Smarties” chocolates. The visually distinctive elements of these marks are their bright colourful designs. In stark contrast, the Application Mark is stylised in a long, thin font with square edges, with the tail of the “Y” extending across the bottom of the mark. It is not set against any background, and does not incorporate any device or any colour. The prominent multi-coloured oval devices in Trade Mark Nos. T9803132Z and T0808179I are absent from the Application Mark.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants also rebut the Opponents' submission that the Application Mark is similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks because the letters in the competing marks are white with margins.&nbsp; The Applicants contend that there is little distinctiveness in white letters with margins as such. Distinctiveness lies instead in the way the letters are designed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Application Mark the letters are long and thin with square edges, while in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks the letters are fat and rounded, resembling bubbles. The differences in the distinctive part of the stylisation therefore offset any similarity there might be by virtue of the letters merely being white with margins.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered the parties' submissions in light of the guidelines on visual similarity in <b><i>Ferrero</i></b>.&nbsp; Length-wise, as the Applicants have pointed out, the Application Mark is shorter, with 6 letters, compared to the 8-letter word "SMARTIES" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.&nbsp; Structurally, from the perspective of "<i>whether there are the same number of words</i>", the respective marks each contain one word.&nbsp; From another structural perspective, taking into account how each mark is composed, I find that all the visual elements, such as shapes, colours and layout, in Trade Mark Nos. T9803132Z and T0808179I combine to produce a substantial visual impact that differentiates the Application Mark from the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.&nbsp; Finally, the issue whether the same letters are used in the marks is to be considered.&nbsp; Comparing the 6-letter Application Mark and the 8-letter word "SMARTIES" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks, there are 5 letters in common, namely "M", "A", "R", "T" and "S".&nbsp; Conversely, the respective marks differ from each other in 4 letters, namely "Y", "S", "I" and "E".&nbsp; This exercise is conducted at a high degree of granularity, but it must be borne in mind that the objective of comparing the marks for common letters is to help ascertain whether these marks can be said to be visually similar as wholes.&nbsp; That there are more letters in common than not does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the marks are therefore similar.&nbsp; Here, the beginnings of the respective marks are different; the marks begin with very different letters "M" and "S".&nbsp; The representation of the letter "Y" in the Application Mark is also visually striking, contributing to a distinguishable visual impact as compared with the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.&nbsp; In the present case, I am persuaded by the Applicants' submissions that the Application Mark is not visually similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural Similarity</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A determination of aural similarity involves, as the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Sarika</i></b> opined at [28], "<i>a qualitative assessment of the relative number of syllables which the two marks have in common</i>".&nbsp;

The Opponents contend that the respective marks are almost phonetically identical, claiming that the letter "S" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks is sometimes dropped or inaudible when pronounced and emphasis is placed on "-MARTIES", which is phonetically identical to the Application Mark.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Applicants submit that the first, rather than second, syllable of the respective marks would be emphasized in natural speech.&nbsp;

The Applicants rely on a decision of the UK Comptroller-General in <b><i>Berentzen Distillers International GmbH v Coors Worldwide Inc</i></b> (Application No. 2298297, 17 January 2006).&nbsp; There, the marks in issue were "SCREAMERS" and "CREAMERS".&nbsp; The Comptroller-General held that "<i>the sibilant consonant is one which is aurally distinctive</i>" for the purposes of mark comparison.&nbsp; (However, whether the sound "S" is lost in speech would depend on what word precedes "SCREAMERS" in a given situation.)&nbsp; The Applicants submit that likewise, in the present case, the letter "S" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks is an aurally distinctive sound which distinguishes the respective marks.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opined by Luxmoore LJ and cited with approval by the House of Lords in <b><em>Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld</em></b> <nobr>[1945] RPC 65</nobr>, 72, <i>"the answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another… must nearly always depend on first impression."</i> When the respective marks here are pronounced, it does appear to me that there is significant aural overlap.&nbsp; Although the first – and more heavily stressed – syllables of the marks are not identical, they are similar because of the common sound "MAR" which tends to be prolonged in pronunciation.&nbsp; As for the endings of the marks, they are indubitably identical.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As</span>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">a matter of "<i>first impression</i>", the Application Mark may be aurally similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptual Similarity</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opponents have not made specific submissions on this issue, and perhaps understandably so.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Applicants assert that the word "MARTY" in the Application Mark is a short form of the name "Martin".&nbsp; The presence of " 'S " after the name "Marty" indicates a possessive noun; hence suggesting that the products belong to or are produced by "Marty".&nbsp; This meaning contrasts with the meaning of the word "SMARTY", being the singular form of the word "SMARTIES" in the Opponents' SMARTIES marks.&nbsp;

The court must ultimately conclude <i>whether the marks, when observed in their totality, are similar rather than dissimilar</i>.&nbsp; The three aspects of similarity are meant to guide the court's inquiry but it is not helpful to convert this into a checkbox exercise in which a tick, however faint it might be, in any one box must compel the court to find that the marks are similar when a sensible appraisal of the marks as a whole would show otherwise.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">...

Rather, such considerations are properly reserved for the <i>confusion</i> stage of the inquiry, because that is when the court is called upon the assess the <i>effect</i> of objective similarity between the marks, on the perception of consumers.&nbsp;

In essence, in such proceedings, he will be required to establish that the notional fair use of his mark would not infringe the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor; whereas in infringement proceedings the only question is whether the actual use by the alleged infringer infringes the notional fair use rights of the registered proprietor of the mark...</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is pertinent to have regard to how the Applicants have used the Application Mark on their product packaging, in close proximity below the house brand "Oishi" (see [15]).&nbsp; However, this is but one instance of the possible normal and fair uses of the Application Mark.&nbsp; Another possible normal and fair use would be to use the Application Mark on its own without the sign "Oishi".</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraneous Factors</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b><em><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></em></b>, the Court of Appeal also affirmed the relevance of extraneous factors <em>"to the extent they inform the court as to how the similarity of marks and goods will likely affect the consumer's perception as to the source of the goods",</em> see [83].</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific types of extraneous factors that are permissible, we have guidance from the court in the conclusion at [95]-[96] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>:</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the risk of origin-based confusion is the primary interest sought to be protected by trade mark law, there must be a limit to the range of external factors that may be taken into account to determine whether a sufficient likelihood of such confusion exists. The permissible factors are those which (a) are intrinsic to the very nature of the goods and/or (b) affect the impact that the similarity of marks and goods has on the consumer. The impermissible factors are those differences between the competing marks and goods which are created by a trader's differentiating steps. In other words, factors which are not inherent in the goods, but are susceptible to changes that can be made by a trader from time to time, should not be permissible considerations. In particular, we are satisfied that it is unnecessary, unworkable and impermissible for the court to have regard to such issues as pricing differentials, packaging and other superficial marketing choices which could possibly be made by the trader.

Clearly, the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion. As to the reputation of the mark, <em>Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc v Hyundai Mobis</em> <nobr><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0512.xml&#39;)">[2010] 1 SLR 512</a></nobr></span><span class="linkdrop-menu1"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB">("<em>Mobil</em>") at [74] makes it clear that a strong reputation does not necessarily equate to a higher likelihood of confusion, and could in fact have the contrary effect as in <em>McDonald's Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</em></span> <span lang="EN-GB"><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent(&#39;/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0177.xml&#39;)">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177</a> (see at [64]).</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception: it would be legitimate to take into account factors concerning the very nature of the goods without implicating any steps that are taken by the trader to differentiate the goods. This includes the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type (see [20] above, <em>Mystery Drinks</em> at [48], <em>Lloyd</em> ([23]</font> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><em>supra</em>) at 1352; and <em>Phillips-Van Heusen Corp v OHIM</em> ([20]</font> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><em>supra</em>) at [55]). This factor is not directly dependent on the marketing choices that the trader makes. As alluded to at [94] above, it would also be relevant to have regard to whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers (see generally <em>Hai Tong</em> at [85(c)(i)]), and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase. We refer here to <em>In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Limited for the Registration of a Trade Mark</em> (1906) 23 RPC 774 where it was observed that, having regard to the nature of the article in question (musical instruments), the (high) price at which it was likely to be sold, and the nature of the consumers who are likely to purchase such products ("generally persons of some education"), a man of ordinary intelligence was unlikely to be confused (at 778). The price of the type of product being sold is distinct from the issue of price disparity between the parties' products. The former consideration directly impinges on the degree of care the consumer is likely to pay to his purchase and therefore his ability to detect subtle differences. As observed in <em>Reed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd</em> <nobr>[2003] RPC 12</nobr> at [103], "a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of 50,000 pounds". On the other hand, superficial price disparity between the competing goods, which speak more about the trader's marketing choices rather than differences in the nature of the goods themselves, is not a factor we find relevant to the inquiry.</font></font></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3"><span lang="EN-GB"><em><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">Likelihood of Confusion: Analysis</font></em></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors Relating to the Impact of Marks-Similarity on Consumer Perception</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the degree of similarity of the marks themselves, I have held that the marks are not similar on the whole.&nbsp; However, if I were wrong on this and were to accept that there is marks-similarity, I would be inclined to say that the Application Mark is only marginally more similar to the Opponents' SMARTIES marks than not.&nbsp; Hence, this factor in the consideration of likelihood of confusion lies in the Applicants' favour – "<i>Clearly, the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion</i>" ([96] of <b><i><span class="blueHighlight">Staywell</span></i></b>) and conversely, the lesser the similarity between the marks, the lower the likelihood of confusion.</span></font></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impression given by the respective marks also differs.&nbsp; Apart from the conceptual dissimilarity of the verbal elements of the Application Mark and the Opponents' SMARTIES marks, the colourful visual elements of Trade Mark Nos.

It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has a power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman, Times">The above passage highlights two essential features of goodwill. First, it is the association of a good, service or business on which the plaintiff's mark, name, labelling, etc (referred to generically as the plaintiff's "get-up") has been applied with a particular source. Second, this association is an "attractive force which brings in custom" (id at 224).</font></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><span lang="EN-GB"><font color="#000000" face1="Times New Roman,
